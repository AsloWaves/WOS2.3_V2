## üéØ Unity Editor Setup (Do This Now)

### **Step 1: Configure PlayerShip Prefab**

1. **Open PlayerShip Prefab**
   - Navigate to `Assets/Prefabs/Player/PlayerShip.prefab`
   - Double-click to open in Prefab mode

2. **Add Network Identity**
   - Click "Add Component"
   - Search for "Network Identity"
   - Add it to the prefab root
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** There is NO "Local Player Authority" checkbox in current Mirror
     - Client authority is controlled by NetworkTransform's `syncDirection` instead

3. **Add Network Transform (Unreliable)**
   - Click "Add Component"
   - Search for "**Network Transform Unreliable**"
     - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Unreliable is recommended for player movement (faster, UDP-based)
     - Alternative: "Network Transform Reliable" for critical objects (TCP-like)
   - Configure settings:
     - **Sync Direction:** Client To Server
       - This gives client authority for responsive controls
     - **Sync Position:** ‚úÖ Enabled
     - **Sync Rotation:** ‚úÖ Enabled
     - **Sync Scale:** ‚ùå Disabled
     - **Interpolate Position:** ‚úÖ Enabled (smooth movement)
     - **Interpolate Rotation:** ‚úÖ Enabled
     - **Interpolate Scale:** ‚ùå Disabled
     - **Only Sync On Change:** ‚úÖ Enabled (bandwidth optimization)
     - **Compress Rotation:** ‚úÖ Enabled (saves bandwidth)
     - **Send Interval Multiplier:** 1 (uses global NetworkManager send rate)
     - **Coordinate Space:** Local (default)

4. **Replace Ship Controller**
   - **Remove** the old `SimpleNavalController` component
   - Click "Add Component"
   - Search for "Networked Naval Controller"
   - Add the new `NetworkedNavalController`
   - Assign same ShipConfigurationSO as before
   - Configure all serialized fields (waypoint prefab, line renderer, etc.)

5. **Move InputSystem_Actions to Resources**
   - Find `InputSystem_Actions.inputactions` file
   - Create folder: `Assets/Resources/` (if doesn't exist)
   - **Move** (not copy) InputSystem_Actions into Resources folder
   - This allows NetworkedNavalController to load it dynamically

6. **Remove PlayerInput Component**
   - The NetworkedNavalController will add this dynamically for local player only
   - Remove any existing PlayerInput component from the prefab

7. **Save Prefab**
   - File ‚Üí Save or Ctrl+S
   - Exit Prefab mode

### **Step 2: Set Up Main Scene**

1. **Create NetworkManager GameObject**
   - In Main scene hierarchy, right-click ‚Üí Create Empty
   - Rename to "NetworkManager"
   - Position at (0, 0, 0)

2. **Add WOS Network Manager Component**
   - Select NetworkManager GameObject
   - Click "Add Component"
   - Search for "WOS Network Manager"
   - Add it

3. **Configure WOS Network Manager**

   **Configuration Section:**
   - ‚úÖ Don't Destroy On Load: Checked
   - ‚úÖ Run In Background: Checked

   **Auto-Start Options:**
   - Headless Start Mode: Do Nothing (change to Auto Start Server for dedicated server)
   - Editor Auto Start: Unchecked (manual start for testing)

   **Network Settings:**
   - **Send Rate:** 30 (Hz - global update frequency for all SyncVars)
     - ‚ÑπÔ∏è NetworkTransform uses this rate by default (sendIntervalMultiplier = 1)
   - Network Address: "localhost" (for local testing)
   - Max Connections: 100

   **Scene Management:**
   - Offline Scene: Leave empty (or set to main menu if you have one)
   - Online Scene: "Main" (your ocean scene name)

   **Player Object:**
   - Player Prefab: Drag `Assets/Prefabs/Player/PlayerShip.prefab` here

   **WOS Naval Configuration:**
   - Ocean Spawn Points: (see Step 3 below)
   - Spawn Method: Random (or Round Robin)
   - Naval Send Rate: 30 (should match Send Rate above)

4. **Add Transport Component**
   - With NetworkManager selected, click "Add Component"
   - Search for "KCP Transport"
   - Add it
   - ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED:** KCP Transport (UDP-based, reliable and fast)
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Alternative: Telepathy Transport (TCP-based, more reliable but slower)

   **KCP Transport Settings:**
   - Port: 7777 (default)
   - Dual Mode: ‚úÖ Enabled (supports IPv4 and IPv6)
   - No Delay: ‚úÖ Enabled (reduces latency)
   - Max Retransmit: 30 (good default)

5. **Save Scene**
   - File ‚Üí Save or Ctrl+S

### **Step 3: Create Ocean Spawn Points**

1. **Create Spawn Points Container**
   - In Main scene hierarchy, right-click ‚Üí Create Empty
   - Rename to "OceanSpawnPoints"
   - Position at (0, 0, 0)

2. **Create Individual Spawn Points**
   - Right-click OceanSpawnPoints ‚Üí Create Empty
   - Rename to "SpawnPoint_1"
   - Position at your desired ocean location (e.g., 100, 0, 0)
   - Repeat 2-4 more times at different ocean locations
   - Example positions:
     - SpawnPoint_1: (100, 0, 0)
     - SpawnPoint_2: (-100, 0, 0)
     - SpawnPoint_3: (0, 100, 0)
     - SpawnPoint_4: (0, -100, 0)
     - SpawnPoint_5: (100, 100, 0)

3. **Assign to NetworkManager**
   - Select NetworkManager GameObject
   - In WOS Network Manager component
   - Expand "Ocean Spawn Points" array
   - Set Size to 5 (or however many you created)
   - Drag each SpawnPoint GameObject into the array slots

4. **Save Scene**

### **Step 4: Testing**

#### **Host Mode Test (Single Player)**

1. **Enter Play Mode**
   - Press Play button in Unity Editor

2. **Start Host**
   - Open the NetworkManager HUD (should appear automatically)
   - Click "Host (Server + Client)" button

3. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ Player ship spawns at one of your spawn points
   - ‚úÖ Camera follows the ship
   - ‚úÖ Ship controls work (WASD for throttle/steering)
   - ‚úÖ Console shows: "üö¢ Player returning from port - using port exit position" if returning from port

4. **Test Port System:**
   - Sail to port (blue circle)
   - Press E to enter harbor
   - Verify scene transition
   - Exit harbor (if implemented)
   - Verify return to correct position facing away from port

#### **Multiplayer Test (2 Clients)**

**Requires building an executable:**

1. **Build Settings**
   - File ‚Üí Build Settings
   - Add "Main" scene to build
   - Add "PortHarbor" scene to build (if using)
   - Platform: Windows/Mac/Linux
   - Click "Build" and save executable

2. **Run Host in Editor:**
   - Unity Editor Play Mode
   - Click "Host (Server + Client)"

3. **Run Client in Build:**
   - Launch the built executable
   - Click "Client" button
   - Enter "localhost" as address
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Verify Multiplayer:**
   - ‚úÖ Both players see each other's ships
   - ‚úÖ Both ships move independently
   - ‚úÖ Camera follows only local player
   - ‚úÖ Each player can enter ports independently
   - ‚úÖ Other player is unaffected by port entry
   - ‚úÖ No ghost ships or duplicate spawns
   - ‚úÖ Smooth movement synchronization

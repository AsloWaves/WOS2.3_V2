## 🎯 Game Overview

### Core Concept
**The Vision**: WOS2.3 is a massive-scale tactical 2D naval MMO supporting 300+ simultaneous players in persistent ocean theaters. The core gameplay revolves around **Extraction-Based Naval Combat** - venture into dangerous waters to acquire valuable loot (modules, turrets, crew, resources) through PvPvE combat or resource extraction, then successfully return to friendly ports to secure your gains.

**The Core Loop - "Hunt, Fight, Extract, Survive"**:
1. **Outfitting Phase**: Load ship with ammunition, fuel, and essential supplies at friendly port
2. **Hunting Phase**: Navigate contested waters seeking valuable targets, resources, or opportunities
3. **Combat Phase**: Engage in PvPvE combat against enemy players, NPCs, and pirates across multiple nations
4. **Extraction Phase**: Successfully return to friendly port with valuable cargo and crew intact
5. **Progression Phase**: Sell loot, upgrade ship systems, advance crew skills, and plan next expedition

**Unique Multi-National Dynamics**:
- **300+ Player Servers**: Massive persistent worlds with complex political situations
- **Dynamic Diplomacy**: Nations shift between Peace and War states, but PvPvE always possible
- **Reputation Consequences**: Attacking peaceful nations carries diplomatic penalties
- **Universal Pirate Threat**: Pirate players and NPCs hostile to all nationalities
- **No Fixed Teams**: Fluid alliances and betrayals based on opportunity and politics

**Example Expedition**:
*Captain Schmidt (Germany, Tier 2 Cruiser Königsberg) spots a damaged American destroyer limping toward Pearl Harbor with visible cargo containers. Despite Germany-USA peace treaty, Schmidt decides to attack for the valuable loot. Combat succeeds - destroyer crew evacuates, Schmidt salvages rare fire control modules and 20 tons of chromium ore. However, his reputation with USA drops significantly, restricting access to American ports and creating future diplomatic complications. The loot is only secured when Königsberg safely reaches German-controlled port.*

**High-Stakes Progression**: 
- **Tier 1-4**: Ship recovery guaranteed (100%), escalating module damage risk
- **Tier 5**: Last safe tier, 30% crew casualty chance, critical threshold
- **Tier 6-9**: Permadeath begins - 30% ship loss chance, 40-60% crew casualties
- **Tier 10**: ULTIMATE RISK - 100% ship and crew permadeath
- **All Tiers**: Valuable cargo and progression always at risk
- **Risk Scaling**: Higher tier ships face greater danger even in same zone tiers

### Player Fantasy - "The Captain's Journey"

## 🎮 Core Gameplay


### Crew Management System
*Navy Field-inspired crew card progression with weight-based constraints and permadeath stakes*

#### **Core Philosophy**
The crew system mirrors Navy Field's card-based approach with modern extraction game stakes. Crew cards are **permanent investments** that grow with you across ships, but face **real permadeath risk** in high-tier combat. Unlike traditional MMOs, there are **no ongoing costs** - just initial training and battle replenishment.

#### **Crew Card Fundamentals**

**Card Structure:**
- Each crew card represents a group of sailors (not individuals)
- Cards start **neutral** at Level 1 with no classification
- All cards are functionally identical - no rarity tiers or quality differences
- Maximum level cap: **200**
- Cards gain experience through **combat** and **paid training**

**Acquisition Methods:**
- **Port Recruitment**: Create new Level 1 neutral crew cards at friendly ports
- **Battle Drops**: Capture enemy crew cards from defeated ships (rare)
- **Mission Rewards**: Earn crew cards from campaign missions
- **Player Trade**: Buy/sell crew cards on player market

**Sailor Count Scaling:**
- Crew cards start with few sailors and grow as they level
- **Dynamic Sailor Scaling Formula**:
```
Levels 1-50:   10 + (Level - 1) × 5 sailors
Levels 51-100: 255 + (Level - 50) × 4 sailors
Levels 101-150: 455 + (Level - 100) × 3 sailors
Levels 151-200: 605 + (Level - 150) × 2 sailors

Examples:
- Level 1 Neutral Crew: 10 sailors
- Level 20 Gunner: 105 sailors
- Level 100 Master Gunnery Officer: 455 sailors
- Level 200 Elite Gunner: 705 sailors
```

**Weight System:**
- Each crew card contributes to total ship weight
- Weight calculation: `Sailor Count × Base Weight × Level Modifier`
- **Base Weight**: 0.1 ton per sailor
- **Level Modifier**: 1.0 + (Level / 100)
- Higher level crew = heavier weight per sailor
- Classification does **not** affect weight
- Ships have hard weight limits that restrict high-level crew on small vessels

**Example Weight Scaling:**
```
Level 1 (10 sailors):   10 × 0.1 × 1.01 = 1.01 tons
Level 20 (105 sailors): 105 × 0.1 × 1.20 = 12.6 tons
Level 50 (255 sailors): 255 × 0.1 × 1.50 = 38.3 tons
Level 100 (455 sailors): 455 × 0.1 × 2.0 = 91 tons
Level 200 (705 sailors): 705 × 0.1 × 3.0 = 211.5 tons
```

#### **Ship Crew Positions & Limits**

**Slot System:**
Each ship class has fixed crew positions (like Navy Field module slots):

| Ship Class | Crew Positions | Weight Limit |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| T1 Destroyer | 5 positions | 250 tons |
| T3 Light Cruiser | 8 positions | 600 tons |
| T5 Heavy Cruiser | 12 positions | 1,200 tons |
| T7 Battleship | 15 positions | 1,800 tons |
| T10 Carrier | 20 positions | 2,500 tons |

**Position Types (Examples):**
- Main Battery Turret #1 (requires Gunner)
- Main Battery Turret #2 (requires Gunner)
- Secondary Battery (requires Gunner)
- AA Battery (requires AA Specialist)
- Engine Room (requires Engineer)
- Damage Control (requires Engineer)
- Radar Station (requires Electronics)
- Aircraft Squadron #1 (requires Aviation, carriers only)

**Strategic Tension:**
High-level crew cards weigh too much for small ships, creating natural progression:
- T1 DD can't fit Level 150+ crew cards (too heavy)
- T5 BB can support mix of high/mid-level crew
- T10 ships can field full elite crew rosters

#### **Classification System** 
*Multi-tier specialization inspired by Navy Field*

**Tier 1: Basic Classification (Unlocks at Level TBD)**
- **Gunner**: Operates main/secondary turrets
- **AA Specialist**: Operates anti-aircraft batteries  
- **Torpedoman**: Operates torpedo tubes
- **Engineer**: Operates engines and propulsion
- **Damage Control**: Operates repair systems
- **Electronics**: Operates radar/sonar/fire control
- **Aviation**: Operates aircraft (carriers/seaplanes)
- **Command**: Operates bridge systems (buffs)

**Tier 2: Advanced Specialization (Unlocks at Level TBD)**
Examples within Gunner path:
- **Fire Control Gunner**: Bonus to accuracy systems
- **Heavy Gunner**: Bonus to large-caliber weapons (14"+ guns)
- **Rapid Fire Gunner**: Bonus to reload speed

**Tier 3: Elite Specialization (Unlocks at Level TBD)**
Examples:
- **Master Gunnery Officer**: Ultimate accuracy + damage bonuses
- **Veteran Helmsman**: Elite evasion and positioning

**Classification Rules:**
- ✅ Choose classification at designated level thresholds
- ❌ **No respeccing** - classification is permanent once chosen
- ✅ Specializations stack (Basic → Advanced → Elite)
- ✅ Gunner classification works on **all turrets** regardless of ship class
- ✅ Engineer classification works on **all engines** regardless of ship class

#### **Performance & Efficiency**

**Level Matching System:**
Each module/turret has a **recommended crew level** for 100% efficiency:
- Level 90 turret needs Level 90+ crew for full performance
- Lower level crew operates at reduced efficiency
- Higher level crew provides efficiency **bonus**

**Efficiency Curve Examples:**
```
Level 90 Turret Performance:
- Level 1 crew   = 35% efficiency (huge penalty)
- Level 45 crew  = 65% efficiency (half level = half penalty)
- Level 70 crew  = 85% efficiency (close but not optimal)
- Level 90 crew  = 100% efficiency (perfect match)
- Level 120 crew = 115% efficiency (over-leveling bonus)
- Level 200 crew = 130% efficiency (maximum bonus)
```

**Natural Balancing:**
Over-leveling is limited by weight constraints:
- Small ships can't support Level 200 crew (too heavy)
- Large ships benefit from veteran crew investments
- Creates progression incentive (bring crew to bigger ships)

**Casualty Impact:**
Crew cards with reduced sailor counts perform worse:
```
Level 20 Gunner (105 sailors at full strength) = 100% efficiency
Same card reduced to 63 sailors (60% casualties) = 60% efficiency
Same card reduced to 26 sailors (75% casualties) = 25% efficiency

Casualties reduce both effectiveness AND card weight proportionally
```

#### **Experience & Progression**

**XP Sources:**
1. **Combat Experience**:
   - Gain XP per battle based on performance
   - More XP for kills, damage dealt, objectives completed
   - Crew must be equipped on active ship during battle
   
2. **Paid Training**:
   - Direct XP purchase at port training facilities
   - Higher levels = exponentially higher training costs
   - Faster progression for players with credits

**Level Brackets & Costs:**
- **Levels 1-50**: Basic training (low cost)
- **Levels 51-100**: Intermediate training (medium cost)
- **Levels 101-150**: Advanced training (high cost)
- **Levels 151-200**: Elite training (extreme cost)

**Classification Unlock Costs:**
- Basic classification unlock: TBD credits
- Advanced specialization unlock: TBD credits (higher)
- Elite specialization unlock: TBD credits (very high)

#### **Battle Casualties & Replenishment**

**During Combat:**
When ship takes damage, crew cards can lose individual sailors:
- Direct hits to crew positions cause casualties
- Fire/flooding kills crew over time
- Critical hits can devastate entire crew cards

**Replenishment System:**
Lost sailors can be replaced at port:
- **Cost scales with crew card level**
- Example: Level 100 Gunnery Officer card (455 sailors) loses 68 sailors (15% casualties)
  - Replenishment cost: ₡6,800 credits (₡100 per sailor × level modifier)
- Higher level crew = more expensive to replenish per sailor

**Performance During Battle:**
Depleted crew cards operate at reduced efficiency until replenished:
- Level 100 card (455 sailors) reduced to 228 sailors = 50% efficiency
- Creates tactical decisions: retreat to replenish or continue weakened

#### **Crew Permadeath System**

**Death Conditions:**
When ship is destroyed at Tier 6+:
- **30% chance per crew card** to die permanently (independent rolls)
- Example: Ship with 6 crew cards dies → expect ~2 card losses
- Dead crew cards are **permanently removed** from player account
- Statistical variance means 0-6 cards could die

**Risk Scaling by Tier:**
- **T1-T4**: Crew always survives (0% death chance regardless of level)
- **T5**: First permadeath tier (30% crew death chance **per card**)
- **T6-T9**: Standard permadeath (30% crew death chance **per card**)
- **T10**: Ultimate permadeath (100% crew death chance - **all crew cards die**)

**Important**: **ANY level crew card can die** at T5+ tiers. Level 1 neutral crew and Level 200 elite crew have the same 30% death chance. Level does not affect survival probability.

**Strategic Impact:**
- High-level crew cards represent **months of investment**
- Level 200 elite crew card = hundreds of hours + millions of credits
- Permadeath creates meaningful risk/reward decisions
- Backup crew cards essential for high-tier operations
- Lower-level backup crews can keep ship operational if elite crews lost

#### **Crew Retrieval & Rescue System**

**Death Location Mechanics:**
When crew cards "die" in battle:
1. Death location marked on map with **retrieval timer**
2. Original player can **return to location** within time window
3. Successfully reaching death spot = crew cards "rescued" (recovered)
4. Timer expiration = crew cards **permanently lost**

**Retrieval Timer Examples:**
- Safe Zone Death (T1-T3): 60 minutes real-time
- Contested Zone Death (T4-T6): 30 minutes real-time  
- Hostile Zone Death (T7-T9): 15 minutes real-time
- Permadeath Zone (T10): No retrieval possible

**Player-to-Player Retrieval:**
Other players can retrieve dead crew for rewards:
1. Dead crew locations visible on map to all players
2. Any player can travel to death location
3. Retrieve crew cards and return to port
4. Original owner **notified** of retrieval
5. Can **negotiate ransom** or **reward retrieval player**

**Retrieval Rewards:**
- Base reward: Percentage of crew card's training value
- Ransom negotiations: Player-determined prices
- Reputation gain with crew's nation
- Special retrieval missions with bonus rewards

**Strategic Gameplay:**
- "Corpse running" becomes viable tactic
- Creates emergent player interactions
- Retrieval players = new profession/playstyle
- High-stakes negotiations over valuable crew

#### **Crew Transfer & Ship Progression**

**Unrestricted Transfer:**
- ✅ Move crew cards between ships **freely**
- ✅ **No retraining costs** when switching ships
- ✅ Gunner works on destroyer AND battleship turrets identically
- ✅ Engineer works on all engine types universally

**Progression Strategy:**
As players tier up, they bring veteran crew to new ships:
1. Start T1 destroyer with fresh Level 1 crew
2. Level crew to 50-75 through T1-T3 combat
3. Upgrade to T5 cruiser, **transfer same crew cards**
4. Continue leveling crew to 100-125 through T5-T7
5. Reach T10 battleship with **elite Level 150+ crew library**

**Multi-Ship Rotation:**
Experienced players maintain multiple ships with shared crew pools:
- High-tier main ship with best crew
- Mid-tier farming ship with backup crew  
- Low-tier training ship for leveling new crew
- Swap crew cards based on mission requirements

#### **Economic Integration**

**No Ongoing Costs:**
Unlike traditional MMOs, crew cards have **zero maintenance**:
- ❌ No salaries
- ❌ No upkeep fees
- ❌ No morale systems
- ✅ One-time training costs only
- ✅ One-time classification unlock costs only
- ✅ Battle replenishment costs only (when damaged)

**Credit Sinks:**
- Initial crew card creation
- Combat/training XP purchases
- Classification unlock fees
- Battle casualty replenishment
- High-tier crew insurance (optional)

**Player Economy:**
- Trade high-level crew cards on marketplace
- Sell captured enemy crew cards
- Retrieval profession earnings
- Crew card appraisal services

#### **Example Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: New Player Progression**
*Captain Murphy starts T1 destroyer*
- Creates 5 neutral Level 1 crew cards at port (100 credits each)
- Assigns to 2 turrets, 1 engine, 1 AA, 1 damage control
- Fights T1-T2 battles, crew reaches Level 25
- Chooses classifications: 2 Gunners, 1 Engineer, 1 AA, 1 Damage Control
- Upgrades to T3 cruiser, transfers same 5 crew cards
- Crew weight still manageable (Level 25-40 range)
- Continues progression to T5 with same core crew

**Scenario 2: Elite Crew Investment**
*Captain Yamamoto operates T8 battleship*
- Main battery crew card: Level 180 Master Gunnery Officer
- 100 sailors, 10.8 tons per sailor = **1,080 tons total**
- Can only fit on T7+ ships (weight restriction)
- Provides 125% efficiency on Level 120 turrets
- Represents 400+ hours of combat + 5M credits investment
- Fights in T8 zones (30% permadeath risk)
- **Loses ship in battle** → 30% chance crew card dies forever
- Card survives → transfers to replacement T8 battleship

**Scenario 3: Crew Retrieval Drama**
*Captain Schmidt (Germany) dies in T7 zone*
- Ship destroyed, 4/6 crew cards marked as "retrievable"
- 20-minute timer starts at death location
- Location in hostile British waters
- Captain Mueller (Germany) sees retrieval marker
- Races to location, dodges British patrols
- Retrieves all 4 crew cards, returns to German port
- Schmidt pays Mueller 50,000 credit reward
- 2 crew cards permanently lost (failed 30% roll)

**Scenario 4: Over-Leveling Problem**
*Captain Jones wants Level 150 crew on T3 cruiser*
- Level 150 crew card = 9 tons per sailor
- 50-sailor card = 450 tons
- T3 cruiser limit = 600 tons total
- Can only fit 1 high-level crew card
- Must use lower-level crew for other positions
- Natural incentive to upgrade to larger ship

**Scenario 5: Casualty Recovery Decision**
*Captain Lee's battleship takes heavy damage*
- Main battery crew card: Level 120, started with 100 sailors
- After prolonged battle: Down to 42 sailors (58 casualties)
- Current efficiency: 42% (severely degraded)
- Options:
  1. Continue mission at 42% gun efficiency (risky)
  2. Retreat to port, pay 8,500 credits to replenish to 100 sailors
  3. Extract with cargo but accept reduced combat capability
- Decision impacts: mission success vs. economic cost vs. tactical risk


### Combat System
*Multi-domain naval warfare with compartmentalized damage and tactical depth*

#### **Core Philosophy**
Combat in WOS2.3 balances **accessibility** (assisted targeting, clear feedback) with **mastery** (manual aiming, module optimization, tactical positioning). The hybrid damage model rewards both precision shooting (critical hits, module damage) and sustained pressure (HP attrition). Multi-domain warfare creates rock-paper-scissors dynamics where submarines threaten battleships, destroyers hunt submarines, and aircraft strike all surface vessels.

#### **Damage Model Architecture**

**Hybrid System: HP Pool + Compartmentalized Damage**

**Primary Health Pool:**
- Every ship has a **total HP value** based on class and tier
- HP represents overall structural integrity
- Reaching 0 HP = ship destruction
- HP visible to all players (yours and enemies)

**Compartmentalized Damage Zones:**
Ships divided into damage zones with individual integrity:
1. **Bow Section** (10% of total HP)
2. **Forward Superstructure** (15% of total HP)
3. **Citadel/Amidships** (40% of total HP) - CRITICAL ZONE
4. **Aft Superstructure** (15% of total HP)
5. **Stern Section** (10% of total HP)
6. **Underwater Hull** (10% of total HP) - submarine/torpedo damage

**Damage Distribution:**
- Hits reduce **both** total HP and zone HP
- When zone HP depletes → zone "destroyed" → special effects
- Example: Bow destroyed → flooding, speed penalty
- Citadel hits deal **1.5x damage** to total HP
- Underwater hits bypass armor, deal **2x flooding damage**

#### **Weapon Systems**

**1. Main Battery Guns**
*Primary anti-ship weapons*

**Shell Types:**
- **Armor-Piercing (AP)**: High penetration, devastating citadels, overpenetrates destroyers
- **High-Explosive (HE)**: Reliable damage, high fire chance (15-25%), universal effectiveness
- **Semi-Armor-Piercing (SAP)**: Middle ground, no overpenetration

**Ammunition Inventory:**
- Shells stored in grid inventory as stackable items
- Stack sizes: Battleship (10/stack), Cruiser (20/stack), Destroyer (50/stack)
- Must balance shell types vs. cargo space for loot
- Running out of ammo = retreat required

**2. Secondary Battery Guns**
- Faster reload (5-8 seconds)
- Shorter range (5-8km)
- Auto-fire mode available
- Higher stacks (100 shells/stack)
- Anti-destroyer defense

**3. Anti-Aircraft (AA) Guns**
- Automatic targeting within AA range
- Creates "AA bubbles" around ship
- Three zones: Long (5-7km), Medium (3-5km), Short (0-3km)
- AA shells auto-consumed from inventory (500+ rounds/stack)

**4. Torpedoes**
- Massive damage (15,000-40,000 HP per torpedo)
- Slow, visible, dodgeable
- Limited ammo (6-16 per ship)
- Large grid items (2x1 or 3x1 cells)
- Types: Standard, Long Lance (Japanese), Acoustic Homing

**5. Depth Charges**
- Anti-submarine warfare weapon
- Dropped from stern or projected
- Area-of-effect damage (spherical blast)
- Must predict submarine depth and position
- Stack size: 20 per stack

**6. Aircraft (Carriers)**
*AI-controlled squadrons with player-directed waypoint system*

**Aircraft Types:**
- Torpedo Bombers (25,000+ HP damage)
- Dive Bombers (8,000-15,000 HP damage)
- Fighters (intercept enemy aircraft)
- Level Bombers (heavy carpet bombing)
- Reconnaissance Planes (vision, spotting)

**Waypoint Control System:**
1. Player launches squadron from carrier
2. Player sets waypoints on map
3. **Last waypoint** = attack target
4. Aircraft AI flies route, attacks final waypoint target
5. Returns to carrier when complete or damaged

**Attack Plans:**
- Manual Route: Draw flight path, flank AA bubbles
- Direct Attack: Click enemy, aircraft fly straight
- Loiter Mode: Circle area, attack targets of opportunity
- Fighter Screen: Escort friendly bombers

**Squadron Management:**
- 2-4 squadron slots per carrier
- Each plane has individual HP
- AA fire shoots down individual planes
- Must restock/repair at carrier using inventory items

**7. Naval Mines**
- Area denial weapon
- Types: Contact, Magnetic, Acoustic
- Large grid items (3x2 cells, don't stack)
- Persist after deployment
- Detection: Visual, minesweeping, sonar (limited)

#### **Targeting & Fire Control Systems**

**Mode 1: Assisted Targeting (Default)**
- Game displays lead indicator
- Accounts for target movement, shell travel time
- Accuracy: 70% base (affected by crew, modules, range)
- Easy for new players

**Mode 2: Auto Targeting**
- Requires "Auto Fire Control" module
- Ship automatically aims and fires
- Accuracy: 60% base (lower than assisted)
- Good for multi-tasking

**Mode 3: Manual Targeting (Advanced)**
- Requires "Manual Fire Director" module
- No lead indicators (pure skill)
- Player calculates all variables
- **+15% accuracy bonus + 25% critical hit chance**
- Highest skill ceiling

**Fire Control Module Progression:**
- Tier 1: +5% accuracy
- Tier 2: +10% accuracy
- Tier 3: +15% accuracy, unlocks manual targeting
- Tier 4: +20% accuracy, improved auto-target
- Tier 5: +25% accuracy, radar fire director (beyond visual range)

#### **Module Damage & Critical Hits**

- Up to 4 simultaneous fires
- Damage: 0.3% max HP/second per fire
- Duration: 60 seconds if not extinguished
- Damage Control Party: Instant extinguish (90s cooldown)

**Flooding System:**
- Torpedo hits: 100% flood chance
- Up to 2 simultaneous floods
- **Light Flooding**: 0.5% max HP/second (90s duration)
- **Heavy Flooding**: 1.0% max HP/second (120s duration)
- **Catastrophic Flooding**: 2.0% max HP/second (rapid sinking)
- Repair reduces flood damage by 50%

**Strategic Trade-off:** Same consumable for fire OR flood - must choose which to address first.

#### **Armor & Penetration System**

**Armor Zones by Ship Type:**

**Battleship Example (T8 Iowa):**
- Belt Armor: 12.1" (307mm)
- Deck Armor: 7.5" (190mm)
- Turret Face: 17.0" (432mm)
- Superstructure: 1.5" (38mm)
- Bow/Stern: 0.75" (19mm)

**Penetration Mechanics:**
- **Full Penetration**: Shell pen > armor = full damage + citadel potential
- **Partial Penetration**: Barely penetrates = 50% damage
- **Non-Penetration (Bounce)**: Shell pen < armor = 10% damage
- **Overpenetration**: Shell pen >>> armor = 33% damage (shell passes through)

**Angling Mechanics:**
- Auto-Bounce Angle: >60° impact = automatic ricochet
- Angled armor counts as thicker (300mm at 45° = effectively 424mm)
- Tactical depth: "Angle your ship" to maximize armor

### Primary Game Loop - Detailed Breakdown
*The core extraction-based naval combat cycle*

#### **Phase 1: Port Preparation (5-15 minutes)**
**Ship Outfitting & Planning**:
- **Ammunition Selection**: Choose shell types based on expected threats (AP for cruisers, HE for destroyers, AA for carrier zones)
- **Fuel Management**: Calculate range requirements - enough for round trip plus combat maneuvering
- **Module Installation**: Swap utility modules based on mission (Sonar for submarine areas, Radar for surface combat)
- **Crew Assignment**: Assign experienced crew to critical stations, new recruits to secondary positions
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Review recent combat reports, player sightings, and resource availability

**Economic Preparation**:
- **Cargo Space Allocation**: Reserve inventory space for expected loot (modules, resources, salvage)
- **Insurance Considerations**: Higher-tier expeditions may require crew life insurance or ship recovery services
- **Supply Purchasing**: Stock medical supplies, repair materials, and emergency rations

#### **Phase 2: Transit & Hunting (15-45 minutes)**
**Navigation Decisions**:
- **Route Planning**: Choose between safe coastal routes (slower, crowded) vs. direct deep ocean (faster, dangerous)
- **Speed Management**: Balance fuel consumption vs. arrival time at optimal hunting grounds
- **Weather Considerations**: Storm systems affect visibility and combat effectiveness
- **Intelligence Updates**: Monitor radio chatter and reconnaissance reports for threat assessment

**Target Acquisition**:
- **Resource Nodes**: Mining operations for rare materials (titanium, tungsten, rare earth elements)
- **NPC Convoys**: Heavily escorted merchant ships with valuable manufactured goods
- **Player Hunting**: Identify vulnerable enemy players carrying valuable cargo
- **Wreck Salvage**: Recent battle sites with salvageable modules and equipment

#### **Phase 3: Combat Engagement (5-30 minutes)**
**Multi-Domain Warfare**:
- **Surface Engagements**: 
  - *Example*: USS Baltimore spots KMS Admiral Hipper at 18km range. Baltimore uses superior radar to maintain firing solution while Hipper attempts to close range for devastating torpedo attack.
- **Submarine Operations**: 
  - *Example*: U-552 (T4 Type VII fleet submarine) stalks British convoy at periscope depth, timing torpedo spread to hit multiple merchants while avoiding destroyer escorts
- **Carrier Aviation**: 
  - *Example*: USS Enterprise launches torpedo bomber strike against Japanese battleship Yamato while simultaneously defending against incoming Zero fighter attack

**Loot Acquisition Methods**:
- **Combat Victory**: Defeated ships drop cargo, modules, and crew equipment for salvage
- **Resource Extraction**: Mining nodes yield raw materials but require time and expose player to attack
- **Boarding Actions**: Close-range capture attempts for intact ships and premium loot
- **Wreck Salvage**: Systematic recovery of valuable components from battlefield debris

#### **Phase 4: Extraction Under Pressure (10-60 minutes)**
**Return Journey Challenges**:
- **Cargo Protection**: Valuable loot makes ship high-priority target for other players
- **Damage Management**: Combat damage reduces speed and defensive capability
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Heavy cargo and battle damage increase fuel consumption
- **Route Selection**: Choose between fastest route (high exposure) vs. safest route (longer, more fuel)

**Dynamic Threat Response**:
- **Player Interdiction**: Enemy players specifically hunt loaded cargo ships near friendly ports
- **NPC Patrols**: Hostile nation forces attempt to prevent successful extractions
- **Pirate Ambushes**: Pirates target damaged, heavily-loaded vessels in transit corridors
- **Environmental Hazards**: Storm systems, shallow waters, and mine fields threaten damaged ships

#### **Phase 5: Port Arrival & Progression (5-10 minutes)**
**Loot Processing**:
- **Cargo Evaluation**: Assess market value of acquired resources and materials
- **Module Integration**: Install captured modules or sell for credits
- **Equipment Repair**: Fix battle damage and replace consumed supplies
- **Crew Advancement**: Surviving crew gain experience and specialization bonuses

**Strategic Planning**:
- **Market Analysis**: Monitor resource prices and identify profitable trading opportunities
- **Reputation Management**: Balance diplomatic consequences of previous actions
- **Fleet Expansion**: Consider purchasing additional ships for diverse operational roles
- **Intelligence Preparation**: Plan next expedition based on updated threat assessment

**Example Complete Loop**:
*Captain Tanaka (Japan, Tier 3 Heavy Cruiser Takao) spends 10 minutes at Truk preparing for convoy raid near Australian waters. Transit takes 20 minutes through contested Pacific zones. Engages British cruiser HMS Kent escorting merchant convoy - 15 minute surface battle results in Kent's retreat and capture of 3 cargo ships carrying chromium and oil. Extraction becomes 35-minute chase as Australian destroyer HMAS Vampire pursues Takao back toward Japanese waters. Successful return to Truk yields 50,000 credits in cargo, rare fire control module, and significant crew experience bonuses. Total session: 80 minutes of high-tension gameplay.*

### **Carrier Movement Controls - Strategic Positioning**

#### **Semi-Auto Movement - Precision Maneuvering**
**Use Case**: Combat situations requiring precise positioning and immediate course changes
- **Waypoint Setting**: Right-click to set navigation waypoints with immediate response
- **Speed Control**: F key (increase speed) / V key (decrease speed) for manual throttle management
- **Continuous Movement**: Ship maintains last bearing and speed after reaching waypoint
- **Course Correction**: Must actively set new waypoints to change direction
- **Tactical Applications**: 
  - Maintaining optimal distance from enemy surface ships (80-120km)
  - Quick course changes to avoid submarine threats
  - Precise positioning for aircraft recovery operations

**Example Scenario**: *USS Hornet operating in contested Pacific waters detects German surface raiders approaching from northwest. Captain switches to Semi-Auto, sets series of waypoints to maintain 90km separation while keeping into-wind heading for aircraft operations. Manual speed control allows optimization of fuel consumption while maintaining tactical flexibility.*

#### **Auto Movement - Operational Efficiency**  
**Use Case**: Long-range transit and sustained flight operations
- **Single Waypoint**: Right-click sets destination with automatic pathfinding and speed optimization
- **Automatic Speed**: Ship calculates optimal speed for fuel efficiency and arrival timing
- **Full Stop**: Automatically stops upon reaching destination to conserve fuel
- **Hands-Free Operation**: Frees player attention for complex aircraft management
- **Strategic Benefits**: Allows focus on air operations during extended missions

**Example Scenario**: *HMS Ark Royal sets Auto-movement waypoint 200km northeast to intercept Italian convoy. Auto-speed maintains 18 knots for optimal fuel consumption. Captain focuses on preparing 3 torpedo bomber wings and 2 fighter escort wings while ship transits autonomously. Upon arrival, switches to Semi-Auto for tactical maneuvering during air operations.*

### **Aircraft Wing Management System - Air Power Coordination**

2. **Battle Damage**: Structural damage requiring immediate attention
3. **Mission Critical**: High-value intelligence or captured enemy pilot
4. **Standard Recovery**: Normal mission completion landing

**Fuel Management Drama**: *Wing 3 (Torpedo bombers) circles carrier with 5% fuel while Wing 1 (Fighters) clears deck after emergency landing. Wing 5 (Dive bombers) also returning with 8% fuel. Player must rapidly coordinate deck operations to prevent loss of 30+ aircraft and crew.*

### **Resource Management - Operational Sustainability**

#### **Aviation Fuel Economics**
**Consumption Rates by Mission Type**:
- **Combat Air Patrol**: 2 fuel units per hour - defensive operations
- **Reconnaissance**: 3 fuel units per hour - extended search patterns  
- **Strike Missions**: 4-6 fuel units per hour - high-performance combat operations
- **Extended Range**: 8+ fuel units per hour - maximum range operations

**Fuel Planning Example**: *HMS Ark Royal (500 fuel units) plans 8-hour patrol mission with 4 wings. Conservative estimate: 4 wings × 8 hours × 3 units = 96 fuel units for routine patrol, 200+ fuel units for combat operations.*

#### **Ammunition Expenditure & Resupply**
**Combat Consumption Rates**:
- **Fighter Engagement**: 50-200 rounds per combat, depending on pilot skill and enemy resistance
- **Bombing Missions**: 100% ordnance expended per mission (single-use bombs/torpedoes)
- **Strafing Runs**: 100-500 rounds per attack depending on target type

**Resupply Challenges**: 
- **Port-Based Resupply**: Full ammunition available at friendly major ports
- **At-Sea Resupply**: Supply ships can transfer basic ammunition only
- **Captured Munitions**: Enemy ammunition requires modification, reduced effectiveness
- **Emergency Operations**: Must return to port when ammunition depleted

### **Carrier Vulnerability & Risk Management**

#### **Tier-Based Risk Scaling**

**Carrier Value = Massive Target**:
- **T1-T4 Carriers**: Moderate threat level, full ship recovery on death
- **T5 Carriers**: High-value target, 30% crew casualties, last safe tier
- **T6-T9 Carriers**: 30-70% permadeath risk, hunted aggressively by players
- **T10 Carriers**: 100% PERMADEATH, server-wide alerts when detected

**Zone Danger Multiplier**:
- T10 carrier in T3 zone = attracts every player within 200km
- Operating carriers in zones below their tier = massive target, little benefit
- Optimal: Match carrier tier to zone danger for balanced risk/reward

#### **High-Stakes Extraction Scenarios**

**Carrier Vulnerability Phases** (applies to all tiers):
1. **Launch Phase**: Stationary target during aircraft launch operations
2. **Recovery Phase**: Predictable course and speed during landing operations  
3. **Refueling Phase**: Vulnerable to submarine attack during support ship rendezvous

**Example Crisis**: *USS Wasp launching strike against Japanese convoy when German U-boat detected at 8km range. Player must choose: Complete aircraft launch (5 minutes vulnerability) or emergency course change (aborting mission, losing prepared strike). Torpedo track detected - 60 seconds to impact. Emergency dive course saves carrier but 2 aircraft crash during aborted landing.*

#### **Multi-Domain Threat Response**
**Threat Integration Management**:
- **Surface Threats**: Enemy destroyers approaching at high speed - aircraft can attack but carrier must maintain distance
- **Submarine Threats**: Underwater contacts requiring immediate course changes - disrupts flight operations
- **Air Threats**: Enemy bombers approaching - must launch fighters while protecting recovery operations

**Complex Tactical Scenario**: *HMS Illustrious (T5 Fleet Carrier) operating 90km off Norway faces simultaneous threats: German surface ships approaching from east, U-boat contact to south, Ju-88 bombers inbound from north. Player must coordinate: fighters to intercept bombers, course change to avoid submarine, while maintaining sufficient distance from surface ships. All while 2 wings return low on fuel.*

This comprehensive carrier operations system scales from T1 escort carriers (basic air operations) through T10 apex carriers (theater-level air dominance). Success requires mastering strategic positioning, multi-domain threat management, resource logistics, crew expertise, and tactical coordination in high-stakes extraction-based gameplay. Lower tier carriers provide forgiving learning environments, while higher tier carriers demand elite gameplay with permadeath consequences.

## ⚙️ **Ship Customization & Module System**

Advanced ship modification system allowing tactical specialization through modular equipment installation, creating unique vessel configurations optimized for specific combat roles and extraction-based missions.

---

## Core Philosophy

Ship customization in WOS2.3 follows a **dual-layer system** inspired by Navy Field's slot-based fitting combined with Escape from Tarkov's tetris-style inventory management. Players have complete freedom to configure ships within physical and weight constraints, with no artificial tier restrictions—if you can fit it and crew it, you can use it.

**Design Principles:**
- **Weight-Based Balancing**: Module and crew weight naturally limits over-fitting on smaller ships
- **Crew-Module Integration**: Every module requires appropriately classed crew card to function optimally
- **Visual Transparency**: Equipped modules visible on ship sprites, creating tactical intelligence opportunities
- **Economic Depth**: Multiple acquisition paths (crafting, market, salvage, black market) with distinct trade-offs
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple at low tiers, deep optimization potential at high tiers

### Armor Weight & Performance Impact

**Weight Calculation Formula:**
```
Zone Weight = Thickness (inches) × Armor Type Weight Multiplier × Zone Size Factor

Example (Iowa Battleship Center Belt):
- Thickness: 12.1" (307.3mm) RHA
- RHA Weight: 40 tons/inch
- Zone Size Factor: 45 (large zone)
- Total Weight: 12.1 × 40 × 45 = 21,780 tons for center belt alone
```

**Performance Impact:**
- **Speed Reduction**: Total armor weight affects max speed
  - Light armor (0-500 tons): No penalty
  - Moderate armor (500-2000 tons): -1 to -3 knots
  - Heavy armor (2000-5000 tons): -3 to -6 knots
  - Extreme armor (5000+ tons): -6 to -12 knots
- **Fuel Consumption**: Heavier ships consume more fuel per km traveled
- **Maneuverability**: Turn rate reduced proportional to total weight

**Armor Cost Calculation:**
```
Zone Cost = Base Cost × Thickness² × Armor Type Multiplier

Example (12" Belt RHA):
- Base Cost: ₡10,000 per zone
- Thickness: 12 inches
- Armor Type: RHA (1.0x multiplier)
- Total: ₡10,000 × 144 × 1.0 = ₡1,440,000 for one belt zone
```

### Armor Acquisition Methods

## Module-Crew Integration System

**Core Principle**: Every module requires an appropriately classed crew card to function at optimal efficiency.

### Crew-Module Assignment Mechanics

**Assignment Process:**
1. **Install Module** in ship slot (hardpoint or internal system slot)
2. **Assign Crew Card** to that module's crew slot
3. **Validation Checks**:
   - Crew class matches module type (Gunner → Turret, Engineer → Engine)
   - Crew card not already assigned to another module
   - Crew skill level meets module minimum requirements (if any)
4. **Result**: Module operates at efficiency based on crew level and specialization

**Crew Class → Module Type Compatibility:**

| Module Type | Required Crew Class | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Main Battery Turret | Gunner | Any gunner works on any caliber |
| Secondary Battery | Gunner | Same crew pool as main battery |
| AA Mount | AA Specialist | Separate class from gunners |
| Torpedo Tubes | Torpedoman | Also operates mine rails |
| Engine | Engineer | Any engineer works on any engine |
| Radar System | Radar Operator (Electronics class) | |
| Sonar System | Radar Operator (Electronics class) | |
| Fire Control System | Gunner (Fire Control specialization) | |
| Damage Control Station | Damage Control (Engineer subclass) | |
| Medical Bay | Medic | Requires research unlock |
| Support Modules | Support Crew | Generic support class |
| Aircraft Catapult | Aviation | Carriers/cruisers/battleships |
| Submarine Periscope | Command | Submarine captains |

### Module Efficiency System

**Crew Level Matching:**

Each module has a **recommended crew level** for 100% efficiency. Crew level vs. module level determines performance:

**Efficiency Curve Formula:**
```
Efficiency % = 35% + (Crew Level / Module Level) × 65%
Capped at 130% maximum (Level 200 crew on Level 90 module)

Examples:
- Level 1 crew on Level 90 module = 36% efficiency (severe penalty)
- Level 45 crew on Level 90 module = 68% efficiency (half level penalty)
- Level 70 crew on Level 90 module = 86% efficiency (close but not optimal)
- Level 90 crew on Level 90 module = 100% efficiency (perfect match)
- Level 120 crew on Level 90 module = 115% efficiency (over-leveling bonus)
- Level 200 crew on Level 90 module = 130% efficiency (maximum bonus)
```

**Efficiency Impact by Module Type:**

**Main Battery Turret:**
- **Reload Speed**: Efficiency % directly affects reload time
  - 100% efficiency = 30 second base reload
  - 130% efficiency = 23 second reload (23% faster)
  - 50% efficiency = 60 second reload (100% slower)
- **Accuracy**: Efficiency % affects hit probability
  - 100% efficiency = 75% hit chance at optimal range
  - 130% efficiency = 97.5% hit chance
  - 50% efficiency = 37.5% hit chance

**Engine:**
- **Max Speed**: Efficiency % affects top speed
  - 100% efficiency = 33 knots
  - 130% efficiency = 35 knots (+6% speed bonus)
  - 50% efficiency = 16.5 knots (-50% speed)
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Higher efficiency = better fuel economy
- **Acceleration**: Efficiency affects time to reach max speed

**Radar System:**
- **Detection Range**: Efficiency % affects maximum detection distance
  - 100% efficiency = 80km base range
  - 130% efficiency = 88km range
  - 50% efficiency = 40km range
- **Update Rate**: Higher efficiency = faster target updates

**Damage Control Station:**
- **Fire Suppression Speed**: Efficiency % directly affects extinguishing time
- **Flooding Control**: Efficiency affects pumping effectiveness

### Unassigned Module Penalty

**Modules without assigned crew operate at 25% efficiency:**
- Main turret with no gunner: 75-second reload instead of 30-second
- Engine with no engineer: 8 knots max speed instead of 32 knots
- Radar with no operator: 20km range instead of 80km
- **Warning Indicator**: Red icon on module slot showing "No Crew Assigned"

**Strategic Implications:**
- Players must maintain adequate crew roster for all equipped modules
- Losing crew cards in battle creates immediate performance degradation
- Backup crew cards essential for high-tier operations

### Multiple Module Management

**Example: Battleship with 3 Main Turrets and 4 Engines:**
- **Turrets**: Requires 3 Gunner crew cards (one per turret)
- **Engines**: Requires 4 Engineer crew cards (one per engine)
- **Minimum Crew**: 7 specialized crew cards just for turrets and engines
- **Realistic Loadout**: 15-20 crew cards total (includes secondaries, AA, support modules)

**Crew Capacity Limits by Ship Class:**

| Ship Class | Total Crew Card Capacity | Typical Module Count |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| T1 Destroyer | 8-12 crew cards | 5-8 modules |
| T3 Cruiser | 12-18 crew cards | 10-15 modules |
| T5 Battleship | 20-30 crew cards | 18-25 modules |
| T8 Carrier | 25-40 crew cards | 25-35 modules |
| T10 Super Battleship | 30-45 crew cards | 30-40 modules |

**Crew Weight Impact:**
- Each crew card has weight based on sailor count and level
- High-level crew cards can weigh 300-1200 tons
- Must balance crew quality vs. ship weight capacity
- Natural progression: bring veteran crew to larger ships as you tier up

1. **Contract Creation**: Player insurer advertises insurance services (rates, terms, reputation)
2. **Customer Purchase**: Other player pays premium to insurer for coverage
3. **Ship Loss Event**: Customer's ship sinks, insurance claim triggered
4. **Salvage Requirement**: Insurer must physically travel to wreck and salvage insured items
5. **Return or Profit**:
   - **Success**: Insurer salvages items, returns to customer, keeps premium as profit
   - **Failure**: Wreck despawns, PvP interruption, or salvage fails → insurer keeps items + premium

**Player Insurer Economics:**
- **Profit Model**: Charge premium upfront, hope to salvage before payout timer expires
- **Risk**: Must physically salvage wreck (travel time, PvP danger, wreck despawn)
- **Reward**: Keep premium + items if salvage fails
- **Reputation System**: Reliable insurers build customer base, scammers get blacklisted
- **Specialization**: Some insurers focus on specific regions (low travel time = higher success rate)

**Example Player Insurance Contract:**
*Insurer "SalvageKing" offers services:*
- Coverage Area: US East Coast (Norfolk to New York)
- Premium: 75% of item value
- Protection: 70% success rate (based on historical performance)
- Return Time: 12-24 hours depending on location
- Reputation: 4.8/5 stars, 150 successful claims

**Player Insurance Advantages:**
- Often cheaper premiums than NPC insurers (competitive pricing)
- Faster return times in specialized regions
- Personalized service (negotiate terms, bulk discounts)
- Supporting player economy and community

**Player Insurance Risks:**
- Lower reliability than NPC companies
- Scam potential (insurer takes premium, never salvages)
- Insurer may be offline when claim occurs
- PvP threats to insurer during salvage missions

### Insurance Return Time System

**Base Return Time Formula:**
```
Base Return Time = 24 hours (from insured port)
Distance Modifier = +1 hour per 100km from insured port
Maximum Return Time = 48 hours total

Example:
- Item insured at Norfolk (US East Coast)
- Ship sinks 300km away in contested waters
- Return Time = 24h base + (300km / 100km) × 1h = 27 hours
```

**Premium Acceleration Option:**
- **Standard Service**: Base return time (as calculated)
- **Expedited Service**: Pay 2x premium → 50% return time reduction
- **Priority Service**: Pay 5x premium → 75% return time reduction

**Return Time Examples:**

| Scenario | Distance | Insurer | Base Time | Accelerated (2x) | Priority (5x) |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Sank near home port | 50km | Lloyd's | 24.5 hours | 12.25 hours | 6.1 hours |
| Contested zone | 300km | Budget Marine | 51 hours | 25.5 hours | 12.75 hours |
| Deep enemy territory | 800km | Premium Naval | 32 hours | 16 hours | 8 hours |
| Maximum distance | 1200km+ | Any | 48 hours (cap) | 24 hours | 12 hours |

### Insurance Claim Process

**When Ship Sinks (T5+ tiers):**
1. **Death Roll**: Each insured item independently rolls for survival
   - Premium Naval (95%): 19 out of 20 items expected to survive
   - Lloyd's (75%): 15 out of 20 items expected to survive
   - Budget (60%): 12 out of 20 items expected to survive
2. **Surviving Items**: Marked as "In Transit" with countdown timer
3. **Countdown Timer**: Based on distance from insured port + insurer return time
4. **Claim Completion**: Items returned to player's inventory at insured port when timer expires
5. **Failed Items**: Items that failed survival roll drop as loot at wreck (other players can salvage)

**Player-Run Insurance Claims:**
1. **Death Event**: Insured player's ship sinks
2. **Notification**: Insurer receives claim notification with wreck location
3. **Salvage Window**: Insurer has limited time to reach wreck (30-60 minutes real-time)
4. **Salvage Process**: Insurer must use Salvage Equipment module to retrieve items
5. **Return Process**: Insurer delivers items to customer at agreed port
6. **Payment**: Insurer keeps premium as profit (already paid upfront)

### Insurance Strategy & Economics

**What to Insure:**
- **High Priority**: Exceptional quality modules (120%+ stats), elite crew cards (Level 100+)
- **Medium Priority**: Standard high-tier modules, mid-level crew cards
- **Low Priority**: Common modules, easily replaceable items, low-tier equipment

**Premium Cost Examples:**

| Item | Market Value | Budget Premium (50%) | Lloyd's Premium (100%) | Premium Naval (200%) |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Exceptional 16" Turret (128% quality) | ₡5,500,000 | ₡2,750,000 | ₡5,500,000 | ₡11,000,000 |
| Level 150 Gunner Crew Card | ₡8,000,000 | ₡4,000,000 | ₡8,000,000 | ₡16,000,000 |
| Advanced Radar System | ₡450,000 | ₡225,000 | ₡450,000 | ₡900,000 |
| Standard Engine Module | ₡180,000 | ₡90,000 | ₡180,000 | ₡360,000 |

**Insurance Math (T8 Battleship Full Loadout):**
- **Total Modules Value**: ₡45,000,000 (3 main turrets, engines, radar, fire control, support modules)
- **Lloyd's Premium (100%)**: ₡45,000,000 for 75% protection
- **Expected Survival**: 33.75M worth of modules survive on average
- **Net Insurance Value**: ₡33.75M return - ₡45M premium = -₡11.25M expected loss
- **Why Insure?**: Worst-case protection (prevent total loss), variance reduction (avoid losing all modules at once)

**Strategic Insurance Use:**
- **Selective Insurance**: Only insure irreplaceable items (exceptional quality, high-level crew)
- **Tier-Based Strategy**: No insurance T1-T4 (no permadeath), selective T5-T7, full coverage T8-T10
- **Premium Tier Selection**: Budget for common items, Premium Naval for exceptional/elite items
- **Player Insurance**: Use for regional operations (fast salvage), trusted community insurers

## Installation & Repair Time System

**Reduced Real-Time Timers for Fast-Paced Gameplay:**

WOS2.3 uses shortened installation and repair timers to keep players engaged and minimize downtime between combat sessions.

### Module Installation Times

**Installation at Port (Friendly Ports Only):**

| Module Size | Installation Time | Concurrent Installation | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Small** | 30 seconds - 2 minutes | Up to 5 simultaneous | AA mounts, sensors, 1x1 modules |
| **Medium** | 2-5 minutes | Up to 3 simultaneous | Secondary turrets, support modules, 1x2 to 2x2 |
| **Large** | 5-15 minutes | Up to 2 simultaneous | Main turrets, engines, 2x3 to 3x3 |
| **Massive** | 10-20 minutes | 1 at a time | Battleship triple 16" turrets, advanced systems |

**Concurrent Installation Mechanics:**
- **Base Capacity**: All ports support 1 concurrent installation by default
- **Hire Shipyard Workers**: Pay fee to unlock additional concurrent slots
  - **Small Port**: ₡5,000 → unlock 2 concurrent slots
  - **Medium Port**: ₡10,000 → unlock 3 concurrent slots
  - **Large Port**: ₡20,000 → unlock 5 concurrent slots
- **Strategic Use**: Install entire ship loadout in parallel (15 minutes vs. 2+ hours sequential)

**Installation Example (T7 Battleship Refit):**
```
Sequential Installation (1 worker):
- 3 main turrets: 15 min each = 45 minutes
- 4 engines: 10 min each = 40 minutes
- 8 support modules: 3 min each = 24 minutes
- 12 AA mounts: 1 min each = 12 minutes
Total: 121 minutes (2 hours 1 minute)

Parallel Installation (5 workers at Large Port):
- Wave 1: 3 main turrets + 2 engines = 15 minutes
- Wave 2: 2 engines + 3 support modules = 10 minutes
- Wave 3: 5 support modules + 5 AA mounts = 3 minutes
- Wave 4: 7 AA mounts = 1 minute
Total: 29 minutes (76% time saved)
```

### Port Repair Times

**At-Port Full Repair (Friendly/Neutral Ports):**

| Damage Severity | Repair Time | Acceleration (2x Cost) | Priority (5x Cost) | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Minor Module Damage** | 1-5 minutes | 30 sec - 2.5 min | 12 sec - 1 min | Radar 75% HP |
| **Major Module Damage** | 5-15 minutes | 2.5 - 7.5 min | 1 - 3 min | Engine 25% HP |
| **Hull Damage** | 10-30 minutes | 5 - 15 min | 2 - 6 min | 40% hull integrity |
| **Critical Rebuild** | 30 min - 2 hours | 15 min - 1 hour | 6 min - 24 min | Multiple destroyed modules |

**Repair Cost Scaling:**
- **Minor Damage**: ₡5,000 - ₡25,000
- **Major Damage**: ₡50,000 - ₡200,000
- **Hull Damage**: ₡100,000 - ₡500,000
- **Critical Rebuild**: ₡500,000 - ₡3,000,000

**Acceleration Options:**
- **Standard Repair**: Base time, base cost
- **Expedited Repair** (2x cost): 50% time reduction
- **Priority Repair** (5x cost): 75% time reduction

**Example Repair (T8 Battleship Post-Combat):**
```
Standard Repair:
- 2 main turrets (major damage): 10 min each = 20 minutes
- 1 engine (minor damage): 3 minutes
- Hull damage (45% → 100%): 25 minutes
- Total Time: 48 minutes
- Total Cost: ₡850,000

Expedited Repair (2x cost):
- Total Time: 24 minutes
- Total Cost: ₡1,700,000

Priority Repair (5x cost):
- Total Time: 12 minutes
- Total Cost: ₡4,250,000
```

Option 1 (Large Repair Kit):
- Use Large Repair Kit: 90 seconds repair time
- Result: Turret restored to 45% HP (functional but reduced performance)
- Can fire but 55% longer reload, 45% accuracy
- Cooldown: 10 minutes before can repair again

Option 2 (Emergency Patch):
- Use Emergency Patch: 45 seconds repair time
- Result: Turret restored to 50% temporary function
- Can fire normally for 30-60 minutes
- Turret breaks again after timer expires (must use another kit or retreat to port)

Strategic Decision: Emergency patch if close to port (30 min away), Large Kit if extended combat expected
```

## Offline Crew Training System

**Passive Progression While Logged Out:**

WOS2.3 implements an offline training system allowing crew cards to gain experience while players are logged out, reducing grind and rewarding long-term progression.

### Core Training Mechanics

**Offline XP Accumulation:**
- **Accumulation Rate**: 1 XP per 10 minutes offline
- **Maximum Cap**: 300 XP per crew card
- **Cap Duration**: ~50 hours offline (3000 minutes ÷ 60 = 50 hours)
- **Claim Requirement**: Must manually claim XP on login (button/notification prompt)

**Training Assignment System:**

**Pre-Logout Assignment:**
1. **Access Training Interface** at any friendly port before logging out
2. **Select Crew Cards** to train (drag crew cards to training slots)
3. **Choose Skill Track** for each crew card:
   - Gunnery (Main Battery, Secondary, AA specializations)
   - Engineering (Propulsion, Damage Control, Repair)
   - Navigation (Piloting, Chart Reading, Weather Prediction)
   - Electronics (Radar, Sonar, Electronic Warfare)
   - Aviation (Aircraft Operations, Carrier Coordination)
   - Command (Leadership, Tactics, Crisis Management)
4. **Confirm Training** and log out

**Post-Login Claim:**
1. **Login Notification**: "5 crew cards have completed training! 300 XP available."
2. **Click Claim**: XP distributed to trained crew cards
3. **Result**: Each crew card gains 300 XP in assigned skill track

**Per-Crew Card XP:**
- Each crew card assigned to training gets **full 300 XP** (NOT shared)
- If 3 crew cards training → Each gets 300 XP = 900 XP total distributed
- If 10 crew cards training → Each gets 300 XP = 3,000 XP total distributed

**Strategic Implications:**
- Incentive to train multiple crew cards simultaneously
- No penalty for training full crew roster
- Encourages maintaining diverse crew library (gunners, engineers, specialists)

### Premium Account Enhancement

**Premium Account Benefits (Optional Monetization):**
- **Standard Account**: Train up to 5 crew cards simultaneously
- **Premium Account**: Train up to 15 crew cards simultaneously (3x capacity)
- **Elite Premium Account**: Train up to 30 crew cards simultaneously (6x capacity)
- **Premium Bonus**: +50% offline XP accumulation rate (1.5 XP per 10 minutes = 450 XP cap)

**Example Comparison (48 hours offline):**

| Account Type | Crew Trained | XP per Crew | Total XP Gained |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Standard | 5 crew | 300 XP | 1,500 XP |
| Premium | 15 crew | 450 XP | 6,750 XP |
| Elite Premium | 30 crew | 450 XP | 13,500 XP |

**Premium Value Proposition:**
- Faster crew development for players with limited playtime
- Supports maintaining multiple ship loadouts (multiple specialized crews)
- Optional (not pay-to-win, just time-saver)

### Training Enhancements

**Training Facility Quality (Port-Based):**

Ports have varying training facility quality, affecting XP gain rates:

| Port Tier | Facility Quality | Offline XP Rate | Cap Increase |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| T0-T1 (Small Port) | Basic | 1 XP / 10 min | 300 XP (base) |
| T2-T3 (Medium Port) | Improved | 1.2 XP / 10 min | 360 XP |
| T4-T5 (Large Port) | Advanced | 1.5 XP / 10 min | 450 XP |
| T6+ (Capital Port) | Elite | 2 XP / 10 min | 600 XP |

**Strategic Port Selection:**
- Logout at capital ports for maximum training benefit
- Trade-off: Capital ports may be in contested zones (risk vs. reward)
- Long-term players establish "training bases" at high-tier friendly ports

**Naval Academy Module** (Ship Module Enhancement):

**Naval Academy Support Module:**
- **Size**: 2x3 (support slot)
- **Effects**:
  - +50% offline XP bonus (stacks with port bonuses)
  - Allows training 3 additional crew cards beyond account limit
  - Reduces XP cost for classification unlocks by 25%
- **Weight**: 45 tons
- **Crew**: 1 Support crew card required
- **Cost**: ₡850,000 (expensive, late-game module)
- **Strategic Use**: Dedicated training ships, crew development focus

**Combined Bonuses Example:**
```
Premium Account + Capital Port + Naval Academy Module:

Base XP Rate: 1 XP / 10 min
Premium Bonus: +50% (1.5 XP / 10 min)
Capital Port: +100% (3 XP / 10 min)
Naval Academy: +50% of base (3.5 XP / 10 min)

Result: 3.5 XP per 10 minutes = 1,050 XP cap (~50 hours offline)
Training Capacity: 15 (Premium) + 3 (Naval Academy) = 18 crew cards
Total XP Distributed: 18 × 1,050 = 18,900 XP per 50-hour offline period
```

**Skill Books** (Consumable XP Boosters):

**Gunnery Manual** (Consumable Item):
- **Effect**: +500 XP instant grant to Gunnery skill
- **Inventory**: 1x1 slot
- **Weight**: 0.1 tons
- **Cost**: ₡50,000 (NPC vendors), ₡35,000-45,000 (player market)
- **Acquisition**: Mission rewards, salvage drops, crafting
- **Strategic Use**: Fast-track specific skills, push crew over level thresholds

**Available Skill Books:**
- Gunnery Manual (Gunner skill)
- Engineering Handbook (Engineer skill)
- Navigation Charts (Navigator skill)
- Electronics Technical Manual (Electronics skill)
- Aviation Operations Guide (Aviation skill)
- Command Leadership Principles (Command skill)

**Veteran Mentorship System** (Crew-to-Crew Training):

**How It Works:**
1. **Assign Veteran Crew** (Level 50+) as mentor
2. **Assign Rookie Crew** (Level 1-49) as student
3. **Offline Training**: Both assigned to same skill track
4. **XP Distribution**:
   - Veteran: Receives 50% normal XP (150 XP at cap)
   - Rookie: Receives 150% normal XP (450 XP at cap)
5. **Mentorship Bonus**: Rookie gains +50% XP, Veteran sacrifices 50% for teaching

**Strategic Use:**
- Fast-track new crew cards to operational levels
- Utilize high-level crew cards that are near cap (Level 180+)
- Efficient use of offline XP pool

**Example Mentorship Setup:**
```
Mentor: Level 150 Master Gunnery Officer (near level cap, slow progression)
Student: Level 15 Rookie Gunner (needs fast development)

Offline Training (48 hours at T3 Port):
- Normal XP Cap: 360 XP
- Mentor Receives: 180 XP (50% normal) → Level 150 → 150.18 (+0.18 levels)
- Student Receives: 540 XP (150% normal) → Level 15 → 20.4 (+5.4 levels)

Result: Rookie crew rapidly promoted to operational levels, veteran crew still progresses (slower but acceptable)
```

### Future Training Enhancements (Potential Updates)

**Possible Future Features:**
- **Raise XP Cap**: Increase from 300 XP to 500 XP or 1,000 XP (balancing required)
- **Faster Accumulation**: Premium tiers with 2 XP / 10 min or 5 XP / 10 min
- **Specialized Training Programs**: Event-based training bonuses (double XP weekends)
- **Cross-Skill Training**: Train multiple skills simultaneously (reduced efficiency)
- **Crew Exchange Program**: Send crew to allied faction ports for unique specializations

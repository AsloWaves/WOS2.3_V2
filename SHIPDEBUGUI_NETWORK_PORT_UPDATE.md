### Feature 2: Nearest Port Navigation

**Location**: New section "NEAREST PORT" in ShipDebugUI

**Information Displayed**:
- **Port**: Name of nearest port (from PortConfigurationSO)
- **Bearing**: **Relative bearing** from ship's bow to port (0-360°)
- **Distance**: Distance in nautical miles

**Relative Bearing Explained**:

```
           0° (Dead Ahead)
              ↑ Bow
              |
315° ←-----[SHIP]----→ 45°
(Port Bow)    ↓      (Starboard Bow)
            Stern

270° ←-----[SHIP]----→ 90°
(Port Beam)           (Starboard Beam)

225° ←-----[SHIP]----→ 135°
(Port Quarter)        (Starboard Quarter)

          180° (Astern)
```

**Bearing Reference**:
- **0°** = Straight ahead (dead ahead)
- **45°** = Starboard bow (right front quarter)
- **90°** = Starboard beam (directly right)
- **135°** = Starboard quarter (right rear quarter)
- **180°** = Dead astern (directly behind)
- **225°** = Port quarter (left rear quarter)
- **270°** = Port beam (directly left)
- **315°** = Port bow (left front quarter)

**Example Display**:
```
NEAREST PORT
Port: Port Royal
Bearing: 045°    ← 45° to starboard (right front)
Distance: 12.3 nm
```

**Navigation Examples**:

**Example 1** (Your Scenario):
- Ship position: (0, 0)
- Ship heading: 0° (facing RIGHT)
- Port position: (10, 0) (directly in front of ship)
- **Bearing: 0°** ✅ (straight ahead, no turn needed)

**Example 2**:
- Ship position: (0, 0)
- Ship heading: 0° (facing RIGHT)
- Port position: (0, 10) (above ship, to the right when facing right)
- **Bearing: 90°** (turn 90° to starboard/right)

**Example 3**:
- Ship position: (0, 0)
- Ship heading: 90° (facing UP)
- Port position: (10, 0) (to the right of ship, behind when facing up)
- **Bearing: 270°** (turn 90° to port/left, or 270° to starboard)

**Example 4**:
- Ship position: (0, 0)
- Ship heading: 180° (facing LEFT)
- Port position: (10, 0) (to the right of ship, behind when facing left)
- **Bearing: 180°** (astern, turn around)

**No Ports Available**:
```
NEAREST PORT
Port: None Detected
Bearing: ---°
Distance: --- nm
```

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Network Statistics (`GetNetworkStats()`)

**How It Works**:
1. Checks if in networked mode (NetworkedNavalController)
2. Verifies Mirror NetworkClient is active
3. Reads `NetworkTime.rtt` for round-trip time
4. Calculates one-way ping (RTT / 2)
5. Determines connection quality based on thresholds
6. Identifies network role (Host/Server/Client)

**Code Location**: `ShipDebugUI.cs` lines 485-534

**Mirror Integration**:
```csharp
// Get RTT from Mirror's NetworkTime
double rttSeconds = NetworkTime.rtt;
int rttMs = Mathf.RoundToInt((float)(rttSeconds * 1000.0));

// Calculate ping (half of RTT)
int pingMs = rttMs / 2;

// Determine mode
string mode = NetworkServer.active ? (NetworkClient.active ? "Host" : "Server") : "Client";
```

**Fallbacks**:
- Not networked → "Network: Single Player Mode"
- Not connected → "Network: Not Connected"

---

### Port Navigation (`GetPortNavigationInfo()`)

**How It Works**:
1. Gets ship's current world position
2. Searches scene for objects with PortConfigurationSO references
3. Calculates distance to each port
4. Identifies nearest port
5. Calculates bearing using `Atan2` (0-360°)
6. Converts distance to nautical miles

**Code Location**: `ShipDebugUI.cs` lines 536-601

**Bearing Calculation** (Relative to Ship):
```csharp
// Calculate absolute world bearing to port
Vector3 directionToPort = nearestPortPos - shipPos;
// IMPORTANT: Atan2(y, x) gives angle from positive X axis (Unity's 0° rotation)
float absoluteBearingRadians = Mathf.Atan2(directionToPort.y, directionToPort.x);
float absoluteBearingDegrees = absoluteBearingRadians * Mathf.Rad2Deg;

// Normalize absolute bearing to 0-360
if (absoluteBearingDegrees < 0)
    absoluteBearingDegrees += 360f;

// Get ship's current heading (where ship is currently pointing)
float shipHeading = shipController.transform.eulerAngles.z;

// Calculate RELATIVE bearing (where ship SHOULD point to reach port)
// Bearing = angle to turn from current heading
// 0° = straight ahead (no turn needed)
// 90° = turn 90° to starboard (right)
// 270° = turn 90° to port (left)
float relativeBearing = absoluteBearingDegrees - shipHeading;

// Normalize relative bearing to 0-360
if (relativeBearing < 0)
    relativeBearing += 360f;
if (relativeBearing >= 360f)
    relativeBearing -= 360f;
```

**Understanding Heading vs Bearing**:
- **Heading**: Where the ship is currently pointing (ship's direction)
- **Bearing**: Where the ship SHOULD point to reach the target (angle to turn)

**Why Relative Bearing?**
- **Real Naval Navigation**: Bearings show how much to turn from current heading
- **Intuitive**: "Bearing 0°" = no turn needed, go straight ahead
- **Tactical**: Easy steering (e.g., "Bearing 30°" = turn 30° to starboard)

**Distance Conversion**:
```csharp
// Assuming Unity scale: 1 Unity unit ≈ 0.01 nautical miles
float distanceNauticalMiles = nearestDistance * 0.01f;
```

**Port Detection**:
- Uses reflection to find MonoBehaviour components with `portConfig` field
- Compares distances and selects nearest
- **Note**: This is a placeholder implementation - production should use PortManager

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Update Rate

Control how often network stats and port info refresh:

**Location**: ShipDebugUI Inspector → "Update Settings" → "Update Rate"

**Recommended Values**:
- **10 Hz** (default): Good balance for most scenarios
- **5 Hz**: Lower performance impact, still responsive
- **20 Hz**: Higher responsiveness (more CPU usage)

**Note**: Network stats and port navigation update at same rate as ship telemetry

---

### Distance Scale Tuning

If port distances seem incorrect, adjust the conversion factor:

**File**: `ShipDebugUI.cs` line 596

**Current**:
```csharp
float distanceNauticalMiles = nearestDistance * 0.01f;
```

**Options**:
- `* 0.01f` - Default (1 Unity unit ≈ 0.01 nm)
- `* 0.005f` - Smaller map scale (1 Unity unit ≈ 0.005 nm)
- `* 0.02f` - Larger map scale (1 Unity unit ≈ 0.02 nm)

**How to find correct scale**:
1. Place port at known distance from ship
2. Measure Unity distance (Vector3.Distance)
3. Calculate: `conversion = real_nautical_miles / unity_distance`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Network Stats Not Showing

**Symptom**: Shows "Network: Not Connected" in multiplayer

**Possible Causes**:
1. NetworkClient not active yet (still connecting)
2. Using SimpleNavalController instead of NetworkedNavalController
3. Mirror not initialized properly

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few seconds after hosting/joining
- Verify NetworkedNavalController is on player ship
- Check console for Mirror connection errors

---

### Port Shows "None Detected"

**Symptom**: Always displays "Port: None Detected"

**Possible Causes**:
1. No ports in scene
2. Ports don't have PortConfigurationSO assigned
3. Port detection reflection failing

**Solutions**:
- Verify ports exist in Main scene
- Check port objects have `portConfig` field assigned
- Create PortManager for better port tracking (recommended)

---

### Ping Shows 0ms

**Symptom**: Network shows "Ping: 0ms" even when connected

**Possible Causes**:
1. Host mode (local server, no real network latency)
2. NetworkTime.rtt not updated yet

**Solutions**:
- In Host mode, 0ms is correct (local connection)
- Wait a few seconds for NetworkTime to stabilize
- Test with remote client for real ping

---

### Bearing Seems Wrong

**Symptom**: Bearing doesn't match where you expect

**Remember**: Bearing is **RELATIVE** to ship's heading, not absolute!
- **0°** = straight ahead (regardless of ship's actual heading)
- **90°** = starboard beam (right side)
- **180°** = astern (behind)
- **270°** = port beam (left side)

**Test**:
1. Face ship directly toward port
2. Bearing should show ~0° (straight ahead)
3. Turn ship 90° right
4. Bearing should show ~270° (port is now on left side)

**If bearing is consistently off by fixed amount**:
- May need to adjust ship sprite rotation
- Verify ship sprite faces RIGHT at 0° rotation
- Check transform.eulerAngles.z matches ship's visual heading

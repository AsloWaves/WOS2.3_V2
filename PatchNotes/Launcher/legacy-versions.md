## Why No Detailed Patch Notes?

Early in development, the launcher evolved rapidly with frequent small updates. The patch notes system wasn't formalized until version 1.0.5, at which point we began maintaining proper documentation.

**All versions from 1.0.5 onwards have full patch notes.**

---

## Migration Path

Users on any version 1.0.0-1.0.4 should update to the latest version:

1. Launch your current launcher
2. Automatic update will trigger
3. Follow on-screen prompts

**Or** download the latest version manually:

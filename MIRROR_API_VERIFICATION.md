# Mirror API Verification Report

## Investigation Summary

User requested verification that the MIRROR_SETUP_GUIDE.md was created using the most up-to-date Mirror documentation. Deep analysis was performed against the **official Mirror GitHub repository**.

---

## Methodology

1. **Source Code Analysis:**
   - Fetched current Mirror source code from GitHub repository
   - Analyzed: NetworkManager.cs, NetworkIdentity.cs, NetworkTransformBase.cs, NetworkTransformUnreliable.cs
   - Verified API signatures and recommended practices

2. **Documentation Cross-Reference:**
   - Attempted to access official Mirror GitBook documentation (some 404 errors)
   - Successfully retrieved GitHub README and source code comments
   - Confirmed API usage patterns from actual implementation

3. **Version Context:**
   - Mirror supports Unity 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and Unity 6
   - GitHub repository reflects latest stable API
   - No specific version number found (continuous development)

## Findings

### ✅ What Was CORRECT

**1. NetworkManager API (100% Correct)**
```csharp
// CORRECT: Current API signature
public virtual void OnServerAddPlayer(NetworkConnectionToClient conn)
{
    Transform startPos = GetStartPosition();
    GameObject player = startPos != null
        ? Instantiate(playerPrefab, startPos.position, startPos.rotation)
        : Instantiate(playerPrefab);
    NetworkServer.AddPlayerForConnection(conn, player);
}
```
✅ Used in WOSNetworkManager.cs - Matches current Mirror API exactly

**2. NetworkIdentity Properties (100% Correct)**
```csharp
// CORRECT: Current properties for ownership checks
NetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer  // ✅ Recommended for local player detection
NetworkIdentity.isOwned        // ✅ Current authority check
NetworkIdentity.isClient       // ✅ Client runtime check
NetworkIdentity.isServer       // ✅ Server runtime check
```
✅ Used correctly in NetworkedNavalController.cs, SimpleCameraController.cs, SimplePortTest.cs, ScenePortManager.cs

**3. NetworkBehaviour API (100% Correct)**
```csharp
[SyncVar(hook = nameof(OnThrottleChanged))]
private float currentThrottle;

[Command]
private void CmdAdjustThrottle(float direction) { }

[ClientRpc]
private void RpcUpdateVisuals() { }
```
✅ All attributes and patterns match current Mirror API

**4. NetworkTransform Configuration (95% Correct)**
```csharp
// CORRECT: Available settings
syncDirection: ClientToServer or ServerToClient  ✅
syncPosition: true/false                         ✅
syncRotation: true/false                         ✅
syncScale: false (recommended for ships)         ✅
interpolatePosition: true (smooth movement)      ✅
interpolateRotation: true (smooth rotation)      ✅
onlySyncOnChange: true (optimization)            ✅
compressRotation: true (bandwidth saving)        ✅
```

### ❌ What Was INCORRECT/OUTDATED

**1. NetworkIdentity "Local Player Authority" Checkbox**
- **Original Guide Said:** "Check 'Local Player Authority' checkbox"
- **Reality:** This checkbox **DOES NOT EXIST** in current Mirror NetworkIdentity
- **Source:** Likely outdated from old UNET or very old Mirror versions
- **Correct Approach:** Client authority is controlled via NetworkTransform's `syncDirection = ClientToServer`

**Impact:** Medium - User would search for non-existent checkbox and be confused

**2. NetworkTransform Component Naming**
- **Original Guide Said:** "Add Network Transform" (singular, generic)
- **Reality:** Mirror has **three NetworkTransform variants:**
  - `NetworkTransformUnreliable` (recommended for movement - UDP-based)
  - `NetworkTransformReliable` (TCP-like reliability)
  - `NetworkTransformHybrid` (mixed approach)
- **No generic "NetworkTransform"** exists - must choose a variant

**Impact:** High - User would not find the exact component name in Unity's Add Component menu

**3. Send Rate Terminology**
- **Original Guide Said:** "Send Rate: 30" as NetworkTransform setting
- **Reality:**
  - NetworkManager has global `sendRate` (correct ✅)
  - NetworkTransform has `sendIntervalMultiplier` (multiplies global rate)
  - Guide was mixing the two concepts

**Impact:** Low - Functionally would still work, but terminology was imprecise

## Corrected Guide

### Original vs Corrected

| Original Guide | Corrected Guide | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| "Check Local Player Authority checkbox" | "No checkbox - authority via syncDirection" | ❌ Fixed |
| "Add Network Transform" | "Add Network Transform Unreliable" | ⚠️ Clarified |
| "Send Rate: 30 (NetworkTransform)" | "Send Interval Multiplier: 1 (uses global)" | ⚠️ Clarified |
| OnServerAddPlayer API | OnServerAddPlayer API | ✅ Correct |
| isLocalPlayer property | isLocalPlayer property | ✅ Correct |
| isOwned property | isOwned property | ✅ Correct |
| SyncVar attributes | SyncVar attributes | ✅ Correct |
| Command/ClientRpc | Command/ClientRpc | ✅ Correct |

---

## Code Impact Assessment

### Files That Use Correct API ✅

**1. WOSNetworkManager.cs**
- Uses correct `OnServerAddPlayer(NetworkConnectionToClient conn)`
- Uses correct `NetworkServer.AddPlayerForConnection()`
- No changes needed

**2. NetworkedNavalController.cs**
- Uses correct `NetworkBehaviour` inheritance
- Uses correct `[SyncVar]`, `[Command]`, `[ClientRpc]` attributes
- Uses correct `isOwned` for authority checks
- No changes needed

**3. SimpleCameraController.cs**
- Uses correct `NetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer` check
- Uses correct `NetworkedNavalController` type
- No changes needed

**4. ScenePortManager.cs**
- Uses correct `NetworkServer.active` check
- Uses correct `NetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer` detection
- No changes needed

**5. SimplePortTest.cs**
- Inherits from `NetworkBehaviour` (correct)
- Uses correct `NetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer` check
- No changes needed

### Unity Editor Setup Impact ⚠️

**What User Must Do Differently:**

1. ❌ **IGNORE:** "Check Local Player Authority" checkbox
   - This checkbox doesn't exist
   - Authority comes from NetworkTransform's syncDirection instead

2. ⚠️ **CHANGE:** Component name
   - Search for: "Network Transform **Unreliable**" (not just "Network Transform")
   - Alternative: "Network Transform Reliable" (slower but more reliable)

3. ✅ **KEEP:** All other settings
   - syncDirection: ClientToServer
   - Sync position/rotation
   - Interpolation enabled
   - Everything else is correct

## Confidence Assessment

### API Verification Confidence: **95%**

**What I'm 100% Certain About:**
- ✅ NetworkManager API (verified from source code)
- ✅ NetworkIdentity properties (verified from source code)
- ✅ NetworkBehaviour attributes (verified from source code)
- ✅ NetworkTransform variants exist (verified from directory listing)
- ✅ syncDirection property exists (verified from source code)

**What I'm 90% Certain About:**
- ⚠️ "Network Transform Unreliable" is the recommended default
  - Source: Component menu attribute in source code
  - Assumption: Unreliable = faster = better for player movement
  - Could verify with official docs or community consensus

**What I'm 80% Certain About:**
- ⚠️ No "Local Player Authority" checkbox exists
  - Not found in NetworkIdentity.cs source code
  - But could be in Unity Inspector serialization or Editor script
  - High confidence it doesn't exist, but not 100%

**What Requires Further Verification:**
- Send rate configuration details (global vs per-component)
- KCP Transport being "recommended" (vs Telepathy or others)
- Unity 6 specific changes (guide mentions Unity 6 support)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Use MIRROR_SETUP_GUIDE_CORRECTED.md** instead of original
   - Fixes the "Local Player Authority" checkbox issue
   - Clarifies NetworkTransform variant naming
   - Improves send rate terminology

2. **Verify NetworkTransform Component Name in Unity**
   - User should open Unity Editor
   - Try "Add Component" → Search "Network Transform"
   - Confirm exact component names available
   - Report back if different from "Network Transform Unreliable"

3. **Test in Unity Editor**
   - Follow corrected guide
   - Document any discrepancies found
   - Check if any settings/options are missing or different

### Long-Term Actions

1. **Mirror Version Pin**
   - Consider pinning specific Mirror version in project
   - Document which version is being used
   - Track breaking changes in Mirror releases

2. **Community Verification**
   - Ask Mirror Discord/forums about:
     - "Local Player Authority" checkbox history
     - NetworkTransform variant recommendations
     - KCP vs Telepathy for naval MMO

3. **Unity 6 Testing**
   - Verify guide works on Unity 6 specifically
   - Check for Unity 6-specific Mirror considerations

# WOS2.3 Testing Checklist - Multiplayer Networking

**Quick Reference**: 5 Unity Editor tasks required before testing | Code fixes already complete ‚úÖ

**Status**: Input System fixed | Ship movement fixed | ShipDebugUI fixed | Spawn point auto-discovery added

---

## ‚úÖ Code Fixes Already Complete

All code fixes are complete - no changes needed to scripts:

1. ‚úÖ **Ship Movement Direction**: Fixed transform.up ‚Üí transform.right (NetworkedNavalController.cs:563)
2. ‚úÖ **Input System**: Direct InputActionAsset loading (no PlayerInput component)
3. ‚úÖ **Spawn Point Auto-Discovery**: WOSNetworkManager finds spawn points at runtime
4. ‚úÖ **ShipDebugUI Multiplayer Support**: Supports both controller types + retry logic for race condition

**See Documentation**:
- ISSUE_DIAGNOSIS.md - Ship movement fix details
- SPAWN_POINTS_SETUP.md - Automatic spawn point discovery
- SHIPDEBUGUI_FIX.md - Complete debug UI fixes (4 changes)
- SCENE_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md - NetworkManager architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: 5 Unity Editor Tasks Required Before Testing

### Fix 1: Remove Duplicate NetworkManager (Main Scene)

**Problem**: "Multiple NetworkManagers detected in the scene" warning

**Steps**:
1. Open **Main.unity** scene
2. Find "NetworkManager" GameObject in Hierarchy
3. **Delete it** (press Delete key)
4. Save scene (Ctrl+S)

**Why**: NetworkManager in MainMenu has DontDestroyOnLoad enabled, so it persists when loading Main scene.

**Validation**: Main scene should have NO NetworkManager GameObject

---

### Fix 2: Create SpawnPoint Tag and Player Layers

**Problem**: Missing tag for spawn point auto-discovery + layer errors

**Steps**:
1. **Edit ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Tags and Layers**

2. **Create SpawnPoint Tag**:
   - Under "Tags" section, click "+" button
   - Type: `SpawnPoint` (exact spelling, capital S and P, no space!)

3. **Create Layers**:
   - Expand "Layers" section
   - **Layer 6**: type `Player`
   - **Layer 7**: type `RemotePlayer`

4. Close Project Settings

**Why**:
- SpawnPoint tag: WOSNetworkManager auto-discovers spawn points by tag when scene loads
- Player layers: NetworkedNavalController sets layer based on ownership

**Validation**:
- Tag "SpawnPoint" exists
- Layer 6 = "Player"
- Layer 7 = "RemotePlayer"

---

### Fix 3: Setup Spawn Points with Auto-Discovery (Main Scene)

**Problem**: Player spawns at origin (0, 0, 0)

**NEW SYSTEM**: Spawn points are automatically discovered at runtime - NO Inspector assignment needed!

**Steps**:
1. Open **Main.unity** scene

2. **Create 5 spawn point GameObjects**:
   - Right-click Hierarchy ‚Üí Create Empty
   - Name: `SpawnPoint_01`
   - Tag: **SpawnPoint** ‚Üê CRITICAL!
   - Position: `(-50, 0, 0)`

   Repeat for:
   - `SpawnPoint_02` ‚Üí Tag: SpawnPoint ‚Üí Position: `(50, 0, 0)`
   - `SpawnPoint_03` ‚Üí Tag: SpawnPoint ‚Üí Position: `(0, 50, 0)`
   - `SpawnPoint_04` ‚Üí Tag: SpawnPoint ‚Üí Position: `(0, -50, 0)`
   - `SpawnPoint_05` ‚Üí Tag: SpawnPoint ‚Üí Position: `(0, 0, 0)`

3. **Save Main scene** (Ctrl+S)

4. **DO NOT try to assign spawn points to NetworkManager!**
   - Unity doesn't allow cross-scene references
   - WOSNetworkManager finds them automatically when Main scene loads

**Why**:
- NetworkManager is in MainMenu scene, spawn points are in Main scene
- Unity doesn't allow cross-scene GameObject references
- WOSNetworkManager.OnServerSceneChanged() auto-discovers spawn points by tag

**Validation**:
- Main scene has 5 GameObjects named SpawnPoint_01 through SpawnPoint_05
- All have Tag = "SpawnPoint"
- Positions are spread out
- Console shows "üéØ Found 5 spawn points in scene" when hosting

**See**: SPAWN_POINTS_SETUP.md for detailed guide

---

### Fix 4: Rename Managers GameObject (Main Scene)

**Problem**: Main scene's managers disappear when scene loads

**Steps**:
1. Open **Main.unity** scene
2. Find "Managers" GameObject in Hierarchy
3. Select it and press F2 (or right-click ‚Üí Rename)
4. Rename to: `MainSceneManagers`
5. Save scene (Ctrl+S)

**Why**:
- MainMenu scene has "Managers" GameObject with DontDestroyOnLoad
- When Main scene loads, persisted "Managers" overwrites Main's "Managers"
- This destroys all managers in Main scene (OceanChunkManager, etc.)
- Different names prevent collision

**Validation**:
- Main scene has "MainSceneManagers" GameObject
- MainMenu scene still has "Managers" GameObject (don't rename that one!)

**See**: SCENE_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md for details

---

### Fix 5: Verify Main Scene Has NO NetworkManager

**Problem**: "Multiple NetworkManagers detected" warning

**Steps**:
1. Open **Main.unity** scene
2. Search Hierarchy for "NetworkManager" or "WOSNetworkManager"
3. **If found ‚Üí DELETE IT** (press Delete key)
4. Save scene (Ctrl+S)

**Why**:
- NetworkManager in MainMenu has DontDestroyOnLoad
- It persists when transitioning to Main scene
- Having one in Main scene creates duplicates

**Validation**:
- Main scene has NO NetworkManager GameObject
- MainMenu scene still has NetworkManager (don't delete that one!)
- Console shows NO "Multiple NetworkManagers" warning when hosting

**See**: SCENE_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md for architecture details

---

## ‚úÖ Already Fixed

- ‚úÖ **Input System**: NetworkedNavalController fixed (no PlayerInput component, direct InputActionAsset)
- ‚úÖ **5-Panel Menu**: MenuManager + ConnectionMenuController + HostMenuController + JoinMenuController + OptionsMenuController
- ‚úÖ **Menu Navigation**: All panels show/hide correctly via MenuManager singleton

---

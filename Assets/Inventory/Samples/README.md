# Samples folder

Here are samples/examples demonstrating the functionalities of the inventory. To grasp a better understanding of how the
inventory operates and how to utilize it, examine the files within this designated folder.

For additional context on the inventory's operations, navigate to the `Core` folder located within
the `Scripts` > `Core` directory. All fundamental features are conveniently organized there for your reference.

## Versioned Folder

The versioned folder contains all the versions from the inventory you have seen on the demo videos. You have the
flexibility to transition from the earliest version to the most recent one by navigating through each scene of your
choice.

It's worth noting that all versions are designed to seamlessly integrate with the latest version of the asset. That are
one of our goals during these asset updates.

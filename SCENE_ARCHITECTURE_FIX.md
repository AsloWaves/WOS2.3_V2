# Scene Architecture Fix - Managers & NetworkManager Conflicts

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. Main scene has WOSNetworkManager (causes duplicate NetworkManager error)
2. "Managers" GameObject name collision (MainMenu overwrites Main scene managers)

## 🚨 Understanding DontDestroyOnLoad Conflicts

### How Unity Handles Scene Transitions

**When you have DontDestroyOnLoad enabled**:
1. GameObject persists across scene loads
2. New scene loads
3. If new scene has GameObject with **same name**:
   - Unity keeps the FIRST instance (from previous scene)
   - Unity DESTROYS the SECOND instance (from new scene)
4. All children of destroyed GameObject are ALSO destroyed

**Example of the Problem**:
```
MainMenu Scene:
└── Managers (DontDestroyOnLoad)
    ├── MenuManager
    └── NetworkManager

Transition to Main Scene:

Main Scene has:
└── Managers ← Unity sees duplicate name!
    ├── CameraController ← Will be DESTROYED
    ├── GameManager ← Will be DESTROYED
    └── SpawnPointManager ← Will be DESTROYED

Result after scene load:
└── Managers (from MainMenu - persisted)
    ├── MenuManager (still alive)
    └── NetworkManager (still alive)

All Main scene managers are GONE!
```

## ✅ Fix 1: Remove NetworkManager from Main Scene

### Steps

1. **Open Main.unity scene**
2. **Hierarchy → Search for "NetworkManager" or "WOSNetworkManager"**
3. **Select the NetworkManager GameObject**
4. **Press Delete key**
5. **Save scene (Ctrl+S)**

### Why This Works

- MainMenu's NetworkManager has DontDestroyOnLoad enabled
- It persists when transitioning to Main scene
- Main scene doesn't need its own NetworkManager
- All NetworkManager functionality (spawning, syncing) works from the persisted instance

### Verification

1. Open Main.unity
2. Hierarchy should have NO GameObject with WOSNetworkManager component
3. Open MainMenu.unity
4. Verify NetworkManager GameObject exists with WOSNetworkManager component

---

## ✅ Fix 2: Rename Managers GameObject in Main Scene

### Steps

1. **Open Main.unity scene**
2. **Hierarchy → Find GameObject named "Managers"**
3. **Rename it to: "MainSceneManagers"** (or "GameManagers", "SceneManagers", etc.)
4. **Save scene (Ctrl+S)**

### Why This Works

- Different name = no conflict with MainMenu's "Managers"
- Main scene's managers will persist and function correctly
- No DontDestroyOnLoad needed for scene-specific managers

### Alternative: Use Scene-Specific Naming Convention

Rename managers in BOTH scenes to be explicit:

**MainMenu.unity**:
- Rename "Managers" → "MenuManagers" (keeps DontDestroyOnLoad)

**Main.unity**:
- Rename "Managers" → "GameManagers" (NO DontDestroyOnLoad)

**PortHarbor.unity**:
- Rename "Managers" → "PortManagers" (NO DontDestroyOnLoad)

## 🏗️ Recommended Scene Architecture

### MainMenu Scene Structure

```
MainMenu.unity
├── Canvas (UI)
│   ├── Panel_Main
│   ├── Panel_Connection
│   ├── Panel_Host
│   ├── Panel_Join
│   └── Panel_Options
│
├── MenuManagers (DontDestroyOnLoad)
│   ├── MenuManager.cs
│   ├── NetworkManager
│   │   ├── WOSNetworkManager.cs
│   │   ├── TelepathyTransport.cs
│   │   ├── NetworkAddressManager.cs
│   │   └── ServerLauncher.cs
│   └── EdgegapDeployHelper (optional)
│
└── EventSystem
```

**Key Points**:
- MenuManagers has DontDestroyOnLoad (or its children do)
- NetworkManager persists across ALL scenes
- MenuManager only active in MainMenu scene

---

### Main Scene Structure

```
Main.unity
├── GameManagers (NO DontDestroyOnLoad)
│   ├── CameraController.cs
│   ├── GameManager.cs
│   ├── SpawnPointManager.cs (if you have one)
│   └── AudioManager.cs (if you have one)
│
├── SpawnPoints (parent)
│   ├── SpawnPoint_01
│   ├── SpawnPoint_02
│   ├── SpawnPoint_03
│   ├── SpawnPoint_04
│   └── SpawnPoint_05
│
├── Main Camera
│   └── CameraController.cs
│
├── Ocean Environment
│   ├── Water
│   ├── Islands
│   └── Obstacles
│
└── (NO NetworkManager - it persists from MainMenu)
```

**Key Points**:
- GameManagers has NO DontDestroyOnLoad (scene-specific)
- NO NetworkManager (uses persisted instance from MainMenu)
- SpawnPoints are scene-specific

### PortHarbor Scene Structure

```
PortHarbor.unity
├── PortManagers (NO DontDestroyOnLoad)
│   ├── PortManager.cs
│   ├── TradingManager.cs
│   └── DockingManager.cs
│
├── SpawnPoints (parent)
│   └── PortSpawn_01 (dock location)
│
├── Main Camera
│   └── CameraController.cs
│
├── Port Environment
│   ├── Docks
│   ├── Buildings
│   └── NPCs
│
└── (NO NetworkManager - it persists from MainMenu)
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Fixes

### Test 1: Verify NetworkManager Persistence

1. **Clear Console**
2. **Play MainMenu scene**
3. **Host server**
4. **Check Console**:
   - ✅ "Host started"
   - ❌ NO "Multiple NetworkManagers" warning
5. **Check Hierarchy (DontDestroyOnLoad section)**:
   - Should see NetworkManager persisted

### Test 2: Verify Main Scene Managers Survive

1. **Play MainMenu scene**
2. **Host server** (transitions to Main scene)
3. **Check Hierarchy**:
   - ✅ "MainSceneManagers" exists (from Main scene)
   - ✅ "MenuManagers" exists (persisted from MainMenu)
   - ✅ Both have their expected children
4. **Check functionality**:
   - Camera follows player (CameraController works)
   - Player spawns correctly (GameManager works)
   - No missing component errors

### Test 3: Check DontDestroyOnLoad Section

After transitioning to Main scene, check Hierarchy:

```
Hierarchy:
├── Main Scene Objects
│   ├── MainSceneManagers
│   ├── SpawnPoints
│   └── Ocean Environment
│
└── DontDestroyOnLoad (special section at bottom)
    └── MenuManagers (or NetworkManager)
        └── NetworkManager
            └── WOSNetworkManager component
```

## 🐛 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Deleting NetworkManager from MainMenu
❌ **WRONG**: Deleting from MainMenu scene
✅ **CORRECT**: Delete from Main scene only

### Mistake 2: Adding DontDestroyOnLoad to Main Scene Managers
❌ **WRONG**: `DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);` in GameManager.Awake()
✅ **CORRECT**: NO DontDestroyOnLoad for scene-specific managers

### Mistake 3: Using Same GameObject Names
❌ **WRONG**: Both scenes have "Managers" GameObject
✅ **CORRECT**: "MenuManagers" (MainMenu) vs "GameManagers" (Main)

### Mistake 4: Adding NetworkManager to Every Scene
❌ **WRONG**: NetworkManager in MainMenu + Main + PortHarbor
✅ **CORRECT**: NetworkManager ONLY in MainMenu (persists to all others)

## 📋 Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Open Main.unity scene
- [ ] Delete NetworkManager GameObject (or WOSNetworkManager component)
- [ ] Rename "Managers" GameObject to "MainSceneManagers"
- [ ] Save Main.unity scene
- [ ] Open MainMenu.unity scene
- [ ] Verify NetworkManager GameObject exists
- [ ] (Optional) Rename "Managers" to "MenuManagers" for clarity
- [ ] Save MainMenu.unity scene
- [ ] Test: Clear Console → Play → Host → Check for warnings
- [ ] Verify Main scene managers still function correctly

---

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

### Console Output
```
[HostMenu] Starting local host...
[HostMenu] ✅ Local host started
[NetworkedNavalController] ✅ Input System initialized
```

**NO warnings**:
- ❌ "Multiple NetworkManagers detected"
- ❌ "Missing component" errors
- ❌ "GameObject destroyed" warnings

### Hierarchy After Transition
```
Main Scene:
├── MainSceneManagers ✅
│   ├── CameraController ✅
│   └── GameManager ✅
├── SpawnPoints ✅
└── DontDestroyOnLoad
    └── NetworkManager ✅ (persisted from MainMenu)
```

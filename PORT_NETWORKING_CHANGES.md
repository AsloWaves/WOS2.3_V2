# Port System Network Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The port entry/exit system has been fully refactored to work with Mirror networking. The system now supports multiplayer gameplay where only the local player can interact with ports, and all state changes are properly synchronized across the network.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. ScenePortManager.cs ✅ COMPLETED

**Previous Behavior:**
- Directly spawned player ships using `Instantiate()`
- Used `SimpleNavalController` references
- No network awareness

**New Networked Behavior:**
- **Does NOT spawn ships** - WOSNetworkManager handles all player spawning
- Only **positions** already-spawned networked players returning from ports
- Uses `NetworkedNavalController` instead of `SimpleNavalController`
- Finds LOCAL networked player using `NetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer`
- Server-authoritative positioning via `NetworkServer.active` checks

**Key Updates:**
```csharp
// NEW: Finds local networked player
private void FindLocalPlayerShip()
{
    var allShips = FindObjectsByType<NetworkedNavalController>(FindObjectsSortMode.None);
    foreach (var shipCtrl in allShips)
    {
        var networkIdentity = shipCtrl.GetComponent<NetworkIdentity>();
        if (networkIdentity != null && networkIdentity.isLocalPlayer)
        {
            localPlayerShip = shipCtrl.gameObject;
            return;
        }
    }
}

// NEW: Positions networked player (server-side)
private void PositionNetworkedPlayer(Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
{
    if (NetworkServer.active)
    {
        localPlayerShip.transform.position = position;
        localPlayerShip.transform.rotation = rotation;
        ResetShipStateAfterPort(localPlayerShip, rotation);
    }
}
```

**Reflection Updates:**
- Now uses `NetworkedNavalController` type instead of `SimpleNavalController`
- Resets SyncVars: `currentThrottle`, `currentSpeed`, `effectiveRudderAngle`

---

### 2. SimplePortTest.cs ✅ COMPLETED

**Previous Behavior:**
- Inherited from `MonoBehaviour`
- Used `SimpleNavalController` references
- Any player could trigger port entry
- No network synchronization

**New Networked Behavior:**
- Inherits from `NetworkBehaviour` for network awareness
- Uses `NetworkedNavalController` and `NetworkIdentity` references
- **Only local player** can interact with ports (`isLocalPlayer` checks)
- Automatically finds and tracks local networked player
- All reflection code updated for `NetworkedNavalController`

**Key Updates:**
```csharp
// NEW: NetworkBehaviour inheritance
public class SimplePortTest : NetworkBehaviour

// NEW: Network-aware player finding
private void FindLocalPlayerShip()
{
    var allShips = FindObjectsByType<NetworkedNavalController>(FindObjectsSortMode.None);
    foreach (var shipCtrl in allShips)
    {
        var networkIdentity = shipCtrl.GetComponent<NetworkIdentity>();
        if (networkIdentity != null && networkIdentity.isLocalPlayer)
        {
            playerShip = shipCtrl.transform;
            playerNetworkIdentity = networkIdentity;
            shipController = shipCtrl;
            return;
        }
    }
}

// NEW: Local player check in Update
private void Update()
{
    // Only process for LOCAL player
    if (playerNetworkIdentity == null || !playerNetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer)
        return;

    // ... rest of update logic
}
```

**Reflection Updates:**
- `StopShipForDocking()`: Uses `NetworkedNavalController` type
- `SimulateHarborEntry()`: Resets network SyncVars (throttle, speed, rudder)
- `SimulateHarborExit()`: Resets network SyncVars before re-enabling controller

---

## How It Works in Multiplayer

### Port Entry Flow (Multiplayer)

1. **Local Player Detection**
   - Port system finds local networked player via `NetworkIdentity.isLocalPlayer`
   - Only local player sees and can interact with port prompts

2. **Docking Zone Entry**
   - Local player enters blue docking circle
   - Ship auto-stops (networked physics synchronized)
   - Port saves entry position/rotation relative to port center
   - "Press E to enter harbor" prompt shown (local only)

3. **Scene Transition**
   - Player presses E to enter harbor
   - PlayerPrefs stores port-relative exit data
   - Scene transitions to PortHarbor scene
   - **Server handles scene management**

4. **Harbor Exit**
   - Player exits harbor scene
   - Returns to Main scene
   - ScenePortManager waits for NetworkManager to spawn player (0.5s delay)
   - **Server-side:** Positions returning player at port-relative exit position
   - Ship faces away from port, throttle/speed/rudder reset to 0
   - **NetworkTransform synchronizes** position/rotation to all clients

### Key Multiplayer Considerations

✅ **Local Player Authority:**
- Each client controls their own ship via client-side prediction
- Port interactions are LOCAL - other players don't see your prompts

✅ **Server Authority:**
- Server validates all position changes
- Port exit positioning is server-authoritative
- SyncVars ensure all clients see correct ship states

✅ **Network Synchronization:**
- NetworkTransform syncs ship position/rotation
- SyncVars sync throttle, speed, rudder states
- All players see each other's ships in correct positions

✅ **Multiplayer Safety:**
- Only local player can interact with their port prompts
- Other players' port interactions don't affect you
- Each player returns to their own port exit position independently

## Testing Checklist

### Single Player (Host Mode)
- [ ] Ship spawns at ocean spawn point
- [ ] Camera follows local player ship
- [ ] Port docking zone auto-stops ship
- [ ] E key enters harbor (when in docking zone)
- [ ] Harbor scene loads
- [ ] Exiting harbor returns to Main scene at port
- [ ] Ship faces away from port, throttle=0
- [ ] Controls work normally after exit

### Multiplayer (2+ Clients)
- [ ] Each player sees their own ship only following camera
- [ ] Both players can move independently
- [ ] Player 1 enters port - Player 2 unaffected
- [ ] Player 1 returns from port at correct exit position
- [ ] Player 2 still sees Player 1's ship moving smoothly
- [ ] Both players can enter different ports simultaneously
- [ ] No ghost ships or duplicate spawns

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Server vs Client Behavior

**Server/Host:**
- Spawns all networked players via WOSNetworkManager
- Handles port exit positioning
- Validates all network state changes

**Client:**
- Receives spawned player from server
- Controls own ship via Commands
- Only interacts with local player's port UI

### ⚠️ PlayerPrefs Usage

Port transition data is stored in PlayerPrefs:
- `PortExit_Valid`: Flag indicating port return
- `PortEntry_PortCenter`: Port center position
- `PortEntry_RelativeOffset`: Ship offset from port
- `PortEntry_PortID`: Port identifier

**Multiplayer Note:** PlayerPrefs is CLIENT-SIDE storage. Each client has their own port return data. This works because:
- Only local player reads their own port data
- Server positions players based on their local PlayerPrefs
- No cross-client contamination

### ⚠️ Unity Editor Setup Required

Before testing, complete Unity Editor setup per `MIRROR_SETUP_GUIDE.md`:
1. Configure PlayerShip prefab with NetworkIdentity + NetworkTransform
2. Set up WOSNetworkManager in Main scene
3. Create ocean spawn points
4. Assign Transport component (KCP recommended)

---

## Code Quality Improvements

✅ **Network-Aware:**
- All components check for local player authority
- Server-authoritative positioning
- Proper SyncVar usage

✅ **Multiplayer Safe:**
- No direct spawning (NetworkManager handles it)
- Local player checks prevent cross-contamination
- Port data properly scoped per-player

✅ **Maintainable:**
- Clear separation: WOSNetworkManager spawns, ScenePortManager positions
- Consistent NetworkedNavalController references
- Reflection updated for all network SyncVars

✅ **Debuggable:**
- Comprehensive network debug logs
- Clear server/client operation indicators
- Network identity logging for troubleshooting

   - Confirm port entry/exit with correct positioning

2. **Test Multiplayer:**
   - Build executable
   - Run Host in Unity Editor + Client in build
   - Test both players entering/exiting ports
   - Verify no cross-contamination or ghost ships

3. **Phase 3: Inventory System** (Next Phase)
   - Build inventory with NetworkBehaviour from start
   - Use SyncList for item collections
   - Server-authoritative item operations via Commands
   - No refactoring needed!
